# StarWAM: A Generalizable Codebase for World-Action Models

StarWAM is a research codebase for building **World-Action Models (WAMs)**: robot policies that combine generative video/world models with action prediction modules. It is designed for modular experimentation with world-model backbones, action representations, and training recipes.

> This repository is an early research release. More WAM variants, benchmarks, model checkpoints, and technical details will be added.

## News

- **2026/07**: RoboTwin 2.0 integration — dual-arm MoT and Shared-DiT recipes with a client/server adapter for the official harness (89.5% and 92.6% over 50 tasks).
- **2026/07**: Initial StarWAM codebase prepared with Wan2.2 and Cosmos-Predict2 backbone adapters, LIBERO training/rollout recipes, MoT WAM, Shared-DiT WAM, and feature-conditioned WAM support.

## Highlights

- **World-model backbones**: reuse pretrained video generation models as robot world models, e.g., Wan2.2 and Cosmos-Predict2.
- **Multiple WAM families**:
  - `mot_wam`: multi-stream video/action experts with mixed attention, e.g., Motus / FastWAM-style world-action modeling.
  - `shared_dit_wam`: shared-DiT/register-token video-action prediction, e.g., DreamZero / LingBot-VA-style shared-token formulations.
  - `feature_conditioned_action_model`: action prediction conditioned on video/world-model features, e.g., Video-IDM, Mimic-Video / World2Action, and StarVLA-WM4A-style variants.
- **Benchmark recipes**: benchmark-specific data loading, normalization, text embedding caches, training recipes, and rollout utilities.
- **Typed recipe system**: YAML recipes are loaded into Python dataclasses without requiring Hydra.

## Model Families

StarWAM organizes WAM methods by taxonomy-level model families. The taxonomy is separated from the video/world-model backbone, so the same WAM family can be instantiated with different backbones.

### `mot_wam`

`mot_wam` uses separate video and action experts and mixes their Q/K/V streams through MoT-style attention. It supports first-frame and full-video action conditioning. This is the first functional LIBERO path in this codebase.

### `shared_dit_wam`

`shared_dit_wam` uses a shared DiT token space for clean video, noisy video, action tokens, and state tokens. Wan Shared-DiT is currently supported; additional backbones can implement the same `build_shared_dit_core(...)` interface.

### `feature_conditioned_action_model`

This family covers action models conditioned on video/world-model features. A single Wan DiT forward extracts observation tokens that condition an ActionDiT flow-matching expert. It is the intended home for Video-IDM, Mimic-Video/World2Action, and StarVLA-WM4A-style variants where a video generation model provides hidden states or generated-video features to an action decoder.

## Examples

Benchmark-specific setup, training, and evaluation instructions are maintained under `examples/`.

- LIBERO examples
- RoboTwin 2.0 examples

## Model Zoo

Pretrained checkpoints are released on ModelScope:
[**panshaohua/starwam**](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/panshaohua/starwam).

LIBERO:

- `starwam-libero/mot/starwam_wan225b_mot.pt` — Wan2.2-TI2V-5B MoT WAM.
- `starwam-libero/sharedit/starwam_wan225b_shareddit.pt` — Wan2.2-TI2V-5B Shared-DiT WAM.
- `starwam-libero/action_stats.json` — shared action normalization stats for both checkpoints.

RoboTwin 2.0:

- `starwam-robotwin/mot/starwam_wan225b_robotwin_mot.pt` — Wan2.2-TI2V-5B dual-arm MoT WAM.
- `starwam-robotwin/sharedit/starwam_wan225b_robotwin_sharedit.pt` — Wan2.2-TI2V-5B dual-arm Shared-DiT WAM.
- `starwam-robotwin/action_stats.json` — z-score action/state normalization stats.

Download:

```bash
pip install modelscope
modelscope download --model panshaohua/starwam --local_dir /path/to/starwam_ckpts
```

See LIBERO examples and RoboTwin 2.0 examples for rollout commands that use these checkpoints.
