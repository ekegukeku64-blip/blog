# ScanDot

*图片：CI*

ScanDot is an experimental Android app for capturing and viewing 3D point clouds on a supported phone. It combines ARCore camera tracking and depth estimates, saves scans locally, and provides an interactive viewer.

The repository also contains a separate video photogrammetry pipeline that runs on a workstation using FFmpeg and COLMAP. **The Android app does not reconstruct ordinary video with photogrammetry on the phone.**

## Current status

- Capture, save and reopen point clouds on devices that support ARCore Depth.
- Rotate, pan and zoom scans in the viewer. An optional full-depth mode interpolates missing depth and can distort surfaces.
- Prepare video frames and run a sparse or dense COLMAP reconstruction on a workstation.

This is an early prototype. Results can contain gaps, drift and noise; they are not textured meshes or validated measurements. Reflective, transparent and textureless subjects are difficult. Capture quality and device compatibility need further testing.

## Try the preview

Download the preview APK. The release notes describe compatibility and signing limitations.

## Build the Android app

You need JDK 17, Android SDK 36, and an Android device with ARCore Depth support. Camera permission is required; Google Play Services for AR may require installation or an update.

```sh
cd android-app
./gradlew assembleDebug lintDebug testDebugUnitTest
```

On Windows, use `gradlew.bat` in place of `./gradlew`. The debug APK is written to `android-app/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Install it as an update to preserve existing app data.

In the app, name the scan, tap **Start scan**, and move slowly around the subject in good light. Save it, then open it from **Results**. Scans are stored in the app's private storage; uninstalling the app removes them.

## Workstation video pipeline

The benchmark requires Python 3.12 or newer, FFmpeg, FFprobe and a compatible COLMAP installation. Dense reconstruction requires a compatible COLMAP configuration. From the repository root:

```sh
python -m processing.benchmark prepare "path/to/input.mp4" --output "path/to/new-run" --fps 5
python -m processing.benchmark reconstruct "path/to/new-run" --colmap "path/to/colmap" --dense
```

The output directory must not already exist. Omit `--dense` for a sparse-only run. See the subcommand `--help` output for options. A successful run does not establish complete or accurate geometry.

The Python tests use the standard library:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Project structure

CI runs the Android build, lint and JVM tests, plus the Python unit tests. It does not exercise a camera, ARCore tracking, GPU reconstruction or measurement accuracy.

See the wiki for installation, capture and troubleshooting guides. See CONTRIBUTING.md for development checks and LICENSE for reuse terms.
