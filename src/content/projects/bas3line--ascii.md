Written in TypeScript by @bas3line. 217 pieces, from full-colour scenes to loaders, charts, language logos, Linux distros, spinning shapes and physics. The donut above turns on a page with one tag: ``. See them all at [ascii.rest](https://ascii.rest).


  
  
  
  
  
  


## Why

I've always been a fan of Markdown files and terminal-style websites: plain text, one monospace face, nothing that moves without a reason. The kind of quiet web that [planetscale.com](https://planetscale.com) does well. So I made this, a way to put a little motion on pages like that without giving up the style. If you like minimalism, this library is for you.

## Install

```sh
npm install ascii.rest
```

Or skip installing: the HTML tag loads everything from ascii.rest. Or copy the source into your project, to keep and change, through shadcn or the CLI:

```sh
npx shadcn@latest add https://ascii.rest/r/ascii.json https://ascii.rest/r/donut.json
npx ascii.rest add ascii donut
```

Every way, with every option, is in [the docs](https://ascii.rest/docs/).

## React and Next.js

```tsx
import { Ascii, Banner } from "ascii.rest/react";
import { donut } from "ascii.rest/pieces";


                          // fetched by name when it mounts

                            // a logo in one ink

```

`Ascii` and `Banner` are client components (`"use client"`), so they go straight into the Next.js app router. Text pieces draw into a `` in its colour and font size; the coloured ones, scenes, logos, companies and distros, draw onto a `` as wide as its container, or into a `` in one ink with `mono`. [React](https://ascii.rest/docs/react/) and [Next.js](https://ascii.rest/docs/nextjs/) in the docs.

## Astro

```astro
---
import Ascii from "ascii.rest/astro";
---


```

The first frame is rendered on the server, so the page is whole before any script runs; the piece starts playing once the page loads.

## HTML, no build step

```html


```

Style it like text: `ascii-art { font-size: 10px; color: teal; }`. The logos, companies and distros come in their own colours; add `mono`, ``, to draw one in the text's colour instead. In a bundled app, `import "ascii.rest/element"` defines the same tag.

## In a GitHub README

A README runs no script, so every logo, company and distro also comes as an animated SVG, one loop of its glint or scan, at `https://ascii.rest/svg/.svg` for light pages and `.dark.svg` for dark ones:

```html

  
  

```

GitHub shows the dark one in its dark theme. Each piece's page on ascii.rest has its snippet under `readme`.

### Banners

Your name, or your project's, in [big text](https://ascii.rest/big-text/)'s block letters with a glint that passes now and then, sized to the text:

```html

  
    
    
  

```

The URL is the banner: `https://ascii.rest/banner/.svg`, and `.dark.svg` for GitHub's dark theme. It takes up to 20 characters, letters, digits, spaces and `. , ! ? ' : - + = / _`, drawn in capitals unless the font is `mixed`, in GitHub's own text colour. The query carries the rest:

| query | |
| --- | --- |
| `color` | the letters' colour, `ff6a00`; more for a fade, `ff6a00,f778ba`; or `art`, the art's own colour |
| `effect` | `glint` by default, a glint every few seconds; `type`, the letters type in once and stay; `still` |
| `speed` | `slow`, `normal` or `fast` |
| `font` | `block` by default, `slim`, `tall`, `bold`, `round`, `wide`, `mixed` (lower case too) or `italic` |
| `shadow` | `double` by default, `single`, `heavy`, `rounded`, `ascii` or `none` |
| `fill` | the letters' character: `shade` by default, `block`, `light`, `hash` or `at` |
| `tagline` | a line under the letters, typed out, up to 60 characters |
| `art` | any logo, company or distro of the library, `rust`, beside the letters, or with `place=right`, `above` or `below` |
| `size` | `s`, `m` by default, or `l`: how big a README shows it |
| `bg` | a colour behind it all, as a card: `0d1117` |

```html

```

[ascii.rest/banner](https://ascii.rest/banner/) makes one as you choose and gives the snippet, in HTML, Markdown, as a URL, in React or in code. Every logo's page has a link that starts one with it. Anyone who prefers reduced motion gets it still. [GitHub README](https://ascii.rest/docs/readme/) in the docs.

### Banners and SVGs in your own code

Everything a URL can choose, and much more, is an option in code. `banner()` makes any text a piece, so it plays wherever a piece does, and `svg()` turns any piece into an animated SVG:

```ts
import { banner } from "ascii.rest/banner";
import { bannerSvg, svg } from "ascii.rest/svg";
import { rust } from "ascii.rest/pieces";

const hello = banner("hello", { font: "slim", shadow: "rounded", fill: "#", color: ["#f97316", "#f778ba"], glint: { every: 5 } });
svg(hello);                                                     // a string: write it to a file, or serve it
bannerSvg("ferris", { art: rust, color: "art", tagline: "fast, safe, fun", place: "above" });
```

Every option of [banner()](https://ascii.rest/docs/banners/) and [svg()](https://ascii.rest/docs/svg/) is in the docs.

### Image to ascii

[ascii.rest/make](https://ascii.rest/make/) turns your own logo or a photo into animated ascii. It takes an SVG, PNG, JPG, WebP or GIF, and works in your browser, so nothing is uploaded. You get an embed for any page, two SVGs for a README, and a piece file to add to the library. [Image to ascii](https://ascii.rest/docs/images/) in the docs.

## In a terminal

```sh
npx ascii.rest rust                        # plays until you press a key
npx ascii.rest night-coast --seconds 10
npx ascii.rest list                        # every piece's name, by category
npx ascii.rest banner 'my cli'             # your text in block letters
```

The logos, companies, distros and scenes play in their own colours, in 24-bit colour. A scene is shrunk to fit the terminal, whatever its size, and drawn in tones, two of its rows in each of the terminal's as half blocks, so the dots it is made of blend as they do on a page. `--mono` draws a coloured piece in the terminal's own colour, for a terminal without 24-bit colour, and `--light` takes the colours meant for a light background. `--fps` and `--seconds` set the speed and the length. The piece plays centred; any other piece wider or taller than the terminal shows only its middle, and it says so when it stops. Piped or redirected, it prints its first frame as text.

### As a splash screen

```ts
import { play } from "ascii.rest/terminal";

const { interrupted } = await play("command-code", { seconds: 2 });
if (interrupted) process.exit(130);
```

`play(piece, options?)` takes a piece module or a name and resolves when the piece stops: after `seconds`, on any key, or on Ctrl+C, which sets `interrupted`. It plays on the alternate screen with the cursor hidden, and puts the terminal back however it stops, on an error too. When the output is not a terminal it draws nothing and resolves at once, so a pipe or a CI log never gets a splash. It uses only Node's own modules.

| option | |
| --- | --- |
| `seconds` | how long it plays; until a key is pressed by default |
| `mono` | draws a coloured piece in the terminal's own colour |
| `light` | for a light terminal: the light colours, and shaded pieces flipped |
| `fps` | frames a second, instead of the piece's own |
| `options` | the piece's option overrides: `{ text: "hello" }` |
| `out` | where it draws: `process.stdout` by default |

It resolves with `{ interrupted, cropped, piece, terminal }`: `cropped` is true when the terminal was smaller than the piece, whose size and the terminal's are in `piece` and `terminal`.

### As a banner

```ts
import { banner } from "ascii.rest/terminal";

await banner("my-cli", { color: ["#ff6a00", "#f778ba"], tagline: "v1.0, fast" });
```

`banner(text, options?)` prints the text in block letters where the cursor is, lets the glint pass once, or the letters type in, and resolves, leaving the banner in the scrollback with the rest of your output, unlike `play()`, which takes over the screen. It takes every option of [banner()](https://ascii.rest/docs/banners/), the font, shadow, fill, effect and colours, and is sized to the text, with narrower letters if the terminal is too narrow for square ones and the plain text if it is too narrow for those. Piped, it prints the banner at once with no colour. With `NO_COLOR` set it leaves out the colours but still moves. Call it at the start of a line, and a terminal too short to show the whole banner gets it still. `npx ascii.rest banner ` takes `--seconds`, `--color`, `--tagline`, `--font`, `--shadow`, `--effect` and `--light`.

| option | |
| --- | --- |
| `seconds` | how long the glint takes to pass, or the letters to type in; 1 by default, 0 prints it still |
| `color` | the letters' colour as `#rrggbb`, or more for a fade along them; the terminal's own by default, and the shadow is dimmed |
| `tagline` | a line under the banner, dimmed, once it has moved |
| `light` | for a light terminal: solid letters that the glint lightens |
| `out` | where it prints: `process.stdout` by default |
| `font`, `shadow`, `fill`, `effect`, … | as [banner()](https://ascii.rest/docs/banners/#options) takes them |

It resolves with `{ cols, rows, interrupted }`: the banner's size, 0 by 0 if it printed the plain text, and `interrupted` if Ctrl+C stopped it moving.

## TypeScript, anywhere

```ts
import { mount } from "ascii.rest";
import { donut } from "ascii.rest/pieces";

const stop = mount(document.querySelector("pre")!, donut, { fps: 12 });
```

## API

The short of it is below; [the docs](https://ascii.rest/docs/api/) have everything each module exports, `ascii.rest/banner` and `ascii.rest/svg` among them.

### `mount(element, piece, options?)`

Plays `piece` in `element` and returns a function that stops it.

- `element`: a `` for text pieces, a `` for the coloured ones (`canvas.has(name)` tells you which). A coloured piece in a `` is drawn in one ink.
- `piece`: a piece module, such as `donut` from `ascii.rest/pieces`.
- `options`: overrides the piece's option defaults, plus `fps` to change its frame rate, and `motion: true` to play even when the reader prefers reduced motion. Pieces hold their first frame for those readers by default; set `motion` only behind a control the reader chooses, like the site's `[play anyway]`.

### `load`, `names`, `canvas`, `isPiece`

From `ascii.rest`. `load["night-coast"]()` imports any piece by name, `names` lists every name, `canvas` is the set of pieces drawn on a canvas, and `isPiece(name)` narrows a string to a piece name.

### `` (React)

| prop | type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `piece` | piece module or name | a module is bundled, a name is fetched when it mounts |
| `options` | object | option overrides, and `fps` |
| `label` | string | what it shows, for screen readers; the piece's name by default |
| `mono` | boolean | draws a coloured piece in one ink, in a `` |
| `className`, `style` | | passed to the `` or `` |

### `` (Astro)

`piece` (a name), `options`, `fps`, `label`, `mono` and `class`.

### ``

| attribute | |
| --- | --- |
| `piece` | a piece's name: `donut`, `night-coast` |
| `src` | or the URL of any module that follows the piece contract |
| `fps` | overrides the frame rate |
| `options` | JSON overriding the option defaults: `'{"text":"hello"}'` |
| `label` | what it shows, for screen readers |
| `mono` | draws a coloured piece in one ink, the text's colour |

## Browser support

Any current browser: it needs ES modules, custom elements and `IntersectionObserver`, plus `ResizeObserver` for the coloured pieces. Importing any module on a server, for server rendering, is safe: nothing touches the DOM until a piece is mounted.

Many pieces draw with box drawing and block glyphs (`─ │ ╭ █ ▄ ░`). Where the system monospace face has none, as on Android, the tag and the Astro component take them from "ascii.rest mono", a 3 KB cut of JetBrains Mono (OFL) served by ascii.rest, so every row keeps its width. Only a browser that lacks the glyphs fetches it. With React, put it in your own ``'s font stack:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "ascii.rest mono";
  src: url("https://ascii.rest/fonts/ascii-rest-mono.woff2") format("woff2");
  unicode-range: U+00B0, U+00B7, U+2022, U+2500-259F, U+25CF;
}
pre.art { font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, "Liberation Mono", "ascii.rest mono", monospace; }
```
