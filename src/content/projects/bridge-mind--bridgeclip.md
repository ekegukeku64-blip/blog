Turn long videos into captioned short-form clips, on your own computer.


  An open-source AI clipping app from BridgeMind.
  Drop in a podcast, stream, YouTube link or Twitch VOD link, and BridgeClip finds the strongest moments,
  cuts them to 9:16 or 16:9, and burns in word-by-word captions.

## Why BridgeClip?

- **No BridgeMind account or backend.** BridgeClip runs on your machine and calls OpenRouter directly with your own provider accounts and keys. Optional social account connections use your Zernio account and API key. Your videos and keys do not pass through a BridgeMind server.
- **Pay only for what you use.** Transcription and clip planning bill your OpenRouter account at their prices. Rendering happens locally with FFmpeg. BridgeClip shows estimated API cost when the providers return usable usage data.
- **Captions that look native.** Nine styles (Viral, Hormozi, Bold, Clean, Minimal, Fire, Glow, Neon, Karaoke), each with a live preview before you render.
- **MIT licensed.** Fork it, change it, ship it.

## How it works

```
 Source video ──▶ Download ──▶ Transcribe ──▶ Find moments ──▶ Render
 (file or link)    yt-dlp      OpenRouter      OpenRouter        FFmpeg
                           MAI Transcribe 2    LLM ranks the     crop, captions,
                               word timings    best moments      one file per clip
```

Every run gets its own folder. The **Library** shows completed clips with virality scores, timecodes and tags. **Jobs** shows what is running or queued right now (up to two clipping runs go at once; more wait in a queue) and every earlier run, including completed, failed, cancelled and interrupted jobs; completed runs open their clips, and failed runs from this session can run again. Older runs without a saved status appear as unfinished. You can optionally connect social accounts through Zernio to publish or schedule a selected clip.

In **Create → Clips**, choose **Quality**, **Economy**, or **Advanced**. Advanced offers searchable OpenRouter model pickers for transcription and clip planning, with model IDs, planning prices and compatibility notes. Both selections are required and appear in Review. Advanced retries the selected models without automatically switching models. Transcription must provide word timestamps; planning must support structured output. See model selection and transcription.

In **Create → Format → Video speed**, choose **1×** (normal), **1.1×**, **1.25×**, **1.5×**, **1.75×**, or **2×** for every clip in the job. Exports preserve voice pitch and keep captions synchronized. Speed works with **Cut dead air** and appears in Review and the saved results. Clip lengths and source trim times refer to the original footage: a 60-second clip at 1.5× exports in about 40 seconds, before any dead-air cuts. The choice stays selected when you clip another video in the same session. Existing exports stay as they are; generate a new job to change their speed.

## Download

**macOS** (Apple silicon and Intel): download BridgeClip from [bridgeclip.ai](https://www.bridgeclip.ai) or Releases, open the disk image and drag BridgeClip to Applications. The macOS builds are signed with BridgeMind's Developer ID and notarized by Apple.

**Windows x64**: download the signed installer or use the Windows button on [bridgeclip.ai](https://www.bridgeclip.ai), then run the installer. The Mac and Windows downloads ship in separate releases; the site selects the newest installer for each platform. Both bundle Python, FFmpeg, and yt-dlp. **Linux** packages are coming soon; use the development setup below. See release status and verification.

BridgeClip keeps itself up to date. It checks Releases shortly after launch and every four hours, downloads a new version in the background, and installs it when you choose **Restart to update** (in the sidebar or **Settings → About**) or the next time you quit. macOS only installs an update signed by the same developer, and every download is checked against the SHA-512 published with the release. Copies run from source, local package builds and apps opened straight from the disk image don't update themselves; **Settings → About** says why. To turn updates off, start BridgeClip with `BRIDGECLIP_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=1`.

On first launch, paste your OpenRouter key into the setup card:

| Provider | Used for | Get a key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenRouter | MAI Transcribe 2 transcription and choosing the moments to clip | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |

Keys are encrypted with your operating system's secure storage. If secure storage is unavailable, BridgeClip asks you to configure or unlock it before saving keys.

### What leaves your computer

For a link, the app downloads the source using your network connection. Audio for MAI Transcribe 2 (Quality), Whisper Turbo (Economy), or your selected transcription model (Advanced) goes to OpenRouter. Transcription retries temporary failures and uses fallback models when needed; Economy tries Whisper Large V3 before MAI. Transcript text for clip planning also goes to OpenRouter. If the video has no audio or no speech, BridgeClip samples video frames and sends those images to OpenRouter for visual-only planning. Clips made through that fallback have no speech captions. Economy skips optional AI layout checks. If you connect social accounts, BridgeClip sends your Zernio API key to Zernio and receives account/profile metadata; platform sign-in occurs in your browser. When you choose **Post** or **Schedule**, BridgeClip uploads that clip to Zernio's media storage and sends its caption, selected accounts and publishing options to Zernio. Zernio then publishes to those platforms. Provider accounts, charges, retention and data policies are governed by those services.

Downloads and intermediate media are held in a private `work/` directory under BridgeClip’s per-user application data folder. BridgeClip removes job work on completion, failure, and cancellation, and clears stale work when it next starts after a forced shutdown. A local video you selected stays where it was. Rendered clips, the transcript, plan and `job_output.json` remain in a run folder under your chosen **Output folder** (by default, `~/BridgeClip`). That JSON includes the source URL or local path and video title. Delete the run folder to remove those local outputs.

Settings, the last synced list of connected accounts (platforms, handles and Zernio IDs), local posting history, and upload retry records live in Electron's per-user application data folder. Posting history can include clip paths and titles, account handles, targets, status and links; retry records can include a clip path and an uploaded media URL. Changing or removing the Zernio key switches to a separate local post history and quarantines the old account and upload retry caches. Returning to the same key restores its saved post history; a newly rotated key has separate history. Quarantined copies remain on disk until a later cleanup after 30 days; to erase them immediately, quit the app and delete the `zernio-*.quarantine-*` files from its application data folder. Key changes do not delete media or posts already held by Zernio or a social platform. Diagnostic logs live in the per-user logs folder. Remove provider keys in Settings to clear their encrypted saved copies, and review logs before sharing them in an issue.

Only download or clip material you have permission to use. Remote sites may limit downloads or change their access rules.

### Clip a Twitch VOD

Paste a public, completed Twitch video link such as `https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1234567890` into Create, then choose your clip settings and generate. BridgeClip downloads the saved video and uses the same transcription, AI moment selection and rendering flow as other sources. Links on `twitch.tv`, `www.twitch.tv`, `m.twitch.tv` and `go.twitch.tv` are accepted and normalized to the canonical video URL.

Live channels, Twitch clips, collections, subscriber-only videos and deleted or expired VODs are not supported. No Twitch login or cookies are used. The original source must be at most six hours and 20 GB. BridgeClip downloads the full source before applying the optional start and end times; a link's timestamp or tracking parameters are ignored. For a longer source, trim a downloaded file before adding it. Downloads also stop after four hours or when less than 1 GB of free space would remain.

## Develop

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22, Python 3.12, and FFmpeg with the libass-backed `ass` filter for captions. The clipping engine, model, fonts, and locked Python dependencies are included in this repository. In development, BridgeClip uses FFmpeg from `engine-bin/` when it exists, then falls back to your `PATH`. Provider keys are needed for live jobs, not tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bridge-mind/bridgeclip
cd bridgeclip
python3.12 -m venv engine/.venv
engine/.venv/bin/pip install --require-hashes -r engine/requirements.lock
npm ci
npm run dev
```

BridgeClip finds its in-repo engine and virtual environment automatically. **Settings → System check** shows the Python, yt-dlp, FFmpeg, and engine checks; set **Python path** in development if you use another interpreter.

On Linux, use system FFmpeg with the libass-backed `ass` filter (`ffmpeg -hide_banner -filters | grep -E '[[:space:]]ass[[:space:]]'`) and Python 3.12. Arch: `sudo pacman -S ffmpeg`. Skip `scripts/prepare-resources.sh` during development; it prepares macOS release resources. Linux development and tests are supported, but a self-contained Linux package is not yet available.

For experimental Windows development, install Python 3.12 and FFmpeg with the `ass` filter on `PATH`, then use PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv engine/.venv
engine/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install --require-hashes -r engine/requirements.lock
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The in-repo Windows virtual environment is detected automatically. Native Windows CI checks the engine, desktop modules, renderer, and production build. Tests that create file symlinks report a skip if Windows denies symlink creation; they run when the account has the required capability. Release-helper tests use Git Bash. The private release pipeline includes Windows installers; a real signed upgrade must pass acceptance before update support is claimed.

Private release workflows package the in-repo engine and media tools for macOS, Windows, and Linux. For local packaging, first run `bash scripts/prepare-resources.sh arm64` (or `x64` on Intel), then follow the release guide. Signing credentials are still required for a distributable build.

### First run and troubleshooting

1. Add your OpenRouter key in the setup card. A saved key is never shown again; paste a new one to replace it or choose **Remove key** in Settings.
2. Run **Settings → System check**. In development, set the Python path if your local virtual environment is not detected.
3. Choose a local video with the file picker or paste a public video link, select clip lengths, framing, and caption style, then start. Smart framing automatically follows faces and arranges screen shares with facecams shot by shot. The optional AI vision check improves ambiguous layouts and can add OpenRouter cost. Dropping a local file opens the picker so you can grant access. Completed runs appear in Library and in your output folder.
4. If a link fails, check it in a signed-out browser or download it yourself and select the local file. If a run fails, use the in-app error and System check first; logs intentionally omit raw provider responses and private source details.
