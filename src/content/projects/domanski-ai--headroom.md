# headroom

**A live dashboard for every Claude and Codex subscription you own — read
straight from the providers *without spending a single token* — that rotates
you to the next account with headroom the moment one hits a limit.**

The heart of headroom is a **live web dashboard you run locally**. Run
`headroom serve`, open `http://127.0.0.1:8377`, and every account's 5-hour,
weekly, and model-scoped capacity is on one page, updating in real time. It's
an ordinary local web page, so it works in any browser on any OS — you're not
tied to one machine. A menu-bar app and pinnable desktop widgets are optional
extras layered on the same data, for a glance without opening a tab.

Five built-in themes (Midnight, Minimal, Chrome, Paper, Terminal), switchable
live from the dashboard. The setup wizard asks how you want it to look.

## Why this exists

If you run more than one Claude or ChatGPT subscription (work + personal +
team), you know the drill: a session dies with *"you've hit your limit"*, you
have no idea how much is left on the other accounts, and you burn ten minutes
logging in and out to find out.

headroom fixes all three problems:

1. **See** — every account's 5-hour, weekly, and model-scoped windows on one
   page, color-coded by what's *left*, not what's used.
2. **Read for free** — usage comes live from the same reads your CLIs already
   use (Anthropic's OAuth usage API; the Codex app-server's rate-limits read).
   Checking your limits never consumes them.
3. **Rotate** — `headroom claude` launches on the highest-ranked account with
   *proven* headroom. Claude accounts are ranked by how much of the `fable`
   model-scoped weekly window they have left, so a fresh session lands where
   you can still switch model family. An explicitly **non-Fable** launch
   (`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) is ranked the opposite way — toward the account
   whose Fable week needs the least protecting — because non-Fable usage
   drains only the account-wide weekly window, and burning that window on the
   wrong account leaves Fable capacity stranded behind a 7-day wall (see
   `headroom fable` below). The order accounts appear in your config breaks
   ties, and an account with no readable scoped reading ranks last among the
   eligible ones; Codex accounts keep config order. Ranking never overrides
   eligibility: an account without proven headroom is skipped whatever it is
   ranked. When a limit hits, `headroom rotate` (or the `/rotator` skill
   inside Claude Code) cools that login down until its window resets and hands
   you the next one. Set a **reserve** (e.g. 10%) and it skips any account
   already below that much headroom, so a session starts fresh instead of
   hitting a wall mid-task.
4. **Maximize** — `headroom fable` is the scoped-pool calculator: per account
   it reports how much of the Fable weekly pool is still *reachable* through
   the account-wide 7-day window, how much is stranded or at risk, and how
   much non-Fable **slack** each account has. The router enforces it: a
   non-Fable launch that would strand Fable capacity is demoted whenever an
   account with positive slack can take the work instead (never when the
   whole fleet is negative — a degraded fleet still routes, least harm
   first). Tune the pool-size assumption with `routing.fable_pool_ratio`
   (default 1.0, deliberately pessimistic); `headroom fable` also shows a
   history-calibrated estimate per account when your usage history supports
   one.

## New in v0.2: automatic Claude conversation handoff

Automatic handoff is **on by default** — uninterrupted continuation is the
point of headroom. `headroom claude` stays resident around the Claude process
it launched. If that exact session reaches a subscription cap, headroom
requires three independent proofs before it acts: a current-session `StopFailure` hook matched as
`rate_limit`, a narrow session/weekly-cap message, and a new identity-bound
usage read showing at least 99% used in the corresponding account or model
window. The active model family comes from the final API-error transcript
event, not the model used when the session launched. Missing or ambiguous
evidence leaves Claude running.

After every non-mutating preflight succeeds, headroom sends Claude one
`SIGTERM`, requires its `SessionEnd` cleanup hook, verifies the final transcript
again, publishes the source bytes plus one content-free headroom boundary
record without overwriting anything in the target account, and resumes with a
forked session. The source transcript is never modified. If post-stop
validation fails, the source session is relaunched
with automation disabled. Three automatic handoffs in any rolling ten minutes
trips the loop guard; the fourth child stays alive. The guard counts
admissions that actually *touched* a session — one that reached its stop, or
one still in flight — so an admission released without ever stopping a child
(an aborted preemptive attempt, a lost target race) cannot spend the budget a
genuine cap needs.

### Waiting for capacity: a cap holds, it does not give up

**When there is nowhere to go, headroom waits instead of giving up.** A cap
that cannot be answered — every other account is capped too — used to disarm
automatic handoff for that child permanently, while it sat on the capped
account: the one state where it most needs to move. Nothing was disproven, and
the condition fixes itself, so headroom now HOLDS the proof (child alive,
automation armed, a `cap_held` event, one stderr line) and re-runs the **full**
preflight every five minutes — nothing is admitted on weaker evidence than a
first attempt would need. The moment an account frees up, the session moves.

Two refusals in that chain hold rather than disarm, because neither is
evidence *against* the cap: no account with headroom worth moving to, and a
usage collect that failed outright. (A third absence gets its own small bound
rather than the hold: if the transcript has not been flushed far enough to say
which model was running when the cap landed, the lookup is given
`HEADROOM_CAP_MODEL_RETRIES` further six-second windows — two by default —
before the child is disarmed.)

The destination bar is part of it: a capped session is never moved onto an
account that is itself about to refuse — 5h at or past the preemptive 5h
threshold, weekly or model-scoped weekly at or past 99%
(`HEADROOM_CAP_TARGET_WEEKLY=100` restores the plain routing bar) — and when
that leaves nothing, the hold message names every account it skipped and why.

The wait is bounded: 60 attempts five minutes apart, so about five hours
(`HEADROOM_CAP_HOLD_SECONDS`, `HEADROOM_CAP_HOLD_MAX`; set the max to `0` for
the old give-up-immediately behaviour). **When the budget runs out** headroom
disarms exactly as it did before the hold existed: it prints the reason and
how long it waited, emits `supervision_lost`, and leaves the child alive and
untouched on the capped account. Nothing is killed and nothing is cooled — the
session is simply no longer being watched, and moving it is now a manual
`/exit` plus `headroom handoff`. Each new cap proof gets its own fresh budget.

If the capped window resets before then, the hold ends with the session still
armed (`cap_cleared`) — there is nothing left to rotate away from.

A cap that fresh usage *contradicts* is not a hold and never was: that still
disarms on the first look. Neither is a **trust** failure — a login the
provider rejected or revoked, a slot bound to a different account than
expected, an organization that changed underneath the slot, a missing CLI or
credential, an API-key seat with no subscription windows at all. Waiting does
not fix any of those, so they disarm immediately instead of spending the
budget. What a *corroborated* cap does wait out is the absence of a reading:
the provider throttling the usage API, a Codex app-server that would not
start, answer, or speak protocol, or one that answered with windows headroom
could not map. (On the very first look there is nothing corroborated yet, so
an unreadable account row disarms there too — a proof nobody can check must
never move a session.)

A hold only ever moves the session on the cap it corroborated when the hold
began, even if a *different* window has hit the wall meanwhile — a
scoped-weekly cap can never turn into the account-wide handoff nobody proved.
On a retry where fresh usage still resolves to exactly that cap, the attempt
simply proceeds on it. Where it resolves to something else — no cap at all, or
a different window — headroom re-reads the *recorded* window in the fresh
snapshot and gets one of three answers. Readable and back below the wall: the
cap is over (`cap_cleared`). Readable and still at the wall: it is not over, so
the session rotates on the recorded cap as soon as an account frees up — set
`HEADROOM_CAP_ROTATE_AT_WALL=0` and it keeps waiting instead. Missing,
malformed, or an expired observation: that proves nothing either way, so the
proof is kept and the wait continues. A window the snapshot simply stopped
reporting is never read as a window that reset.

The same asymmetry runs through the rest of the retry. Missing or ambiguous
reset metadata on a cap that was already corroborated holds; on a first look
it disarms, as it always did.

What comes back is the **conversation**, not the turn that was refused. The
resumed session starts idle: nothing re-sends the prompt Claude refused, and
background tasks, MCP connections and permission state do not survive a
handoff (see `docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md`).

Turn it off in `headroom setup`, or explicitly in config:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "reserve_percent": 0,
    "auto_handoff": false
  }
}
```

### Preemptive rotation: leaving before the wall

A cap-reactive handoff can only fire once the provider has already refused a
turn. A seat that climbs to 97% while your session sits idle would otherwise
strand you: you notice the percentage, `/exit`, and hand off by hand. So the
supervisor also watches the usage feed it already collects and rotates
**early** — when the account crosses **93%** of the model-family window it is
running (e.g. fable), **95%** of the all-model weekly window, or **97%** of
the **5-hour** window, *and* a target seat with proven headroom exists, *and*
the child is idle.

The 5-hour window is deliberately the latest of the three and has its own
rules, because it is the only one that heals by itself. For a session that
will go idle and wait, moving off it buys nothing; for continuous autonomous
work the wall lands mid-task and "it resets in four hours" means four hours of
nothing. So headroom leaves late, and only when leaving actually helps: the
destination must have **real** 5h headroom (by default ten points below the
threshold — swapping 97% for 96% is a restart, not a rotation). If every seat
is near its own 5h cap, headroom **holds and says so** rather than spending a
seat to arrive at the same wall — that hold is the correct answer, not a
failure. Regardless of the trigger, a seat at or past the 5h threshold is
never a rotation *destination*.

"Idle" means no active turn, and quiet is not enough to prove that — a model
can think silently for minutes. So the transcript must have been quiet for a
full minute **and** its newest conversational record must be a finished
assistant turn: a prompt still awaiting its answer, an unanswered tool result,
or a live subagent all mean a turn is in flight and the session stays put.
**Background agents count too**: a backgrounded `Agent` call returns its tool
result immediately and keeps working in its own sidechain transcript
(`projects///subagents/`), so a session whose main thread looks
finished is still busy. Recency is not enough there either — an agent blocked
in one long build writes nothing for an hour — so headroom uses the session's
own records: an agent the transcript shows as launched (or re-messaged with
`SendMessage`) with no later terminal `` is still running,
and any sidechain transcript that ends in unanswered input or an unfinished
tool call is still working. Only the harness's own notification record can
retire an agent — the same envelope quoted inside another tool's output (a
command that prints a transcript, say) is an echo, and an echo bearing a live
agent's id must never clear the way for its stop. Both are bounded by the running child's own
lifetime, so agents that died with an earlier run of a resumed session never
block. Anything unreadable refuses the rotation. No hook
event may be pending, a session stopped mid-tool-call is never moved early,
and idleness is re-proven on the very edge of the stop, after the durable
ledger write, so a turn that starts in that window cancels the stop instead of
being killed by it (and that cancellation is not charged to the loop budget,
because nothing was ever stopped).

The rotation itself is the same pipeline as the cap path — staging, target
identity verification, slot leases, ledger admission, the same
three-per-ten-minutes loop guard, resume with `--fork-session`. Nothing is
cooled, because the seat is not capped, and the handoff is recorded with
`"reason": "preemptive"`.

Preemptive rotation is strictly an optimisation on top of the cap-reactive
guarantee: **any** refusal — no proven target (near-limit seats are skipped in
favour of a healthy one further down the ranking), a busy child, a guard
holding — only defers (with a backoff, so a stranded session never thrashes)
and leaves cap handoff fully armed. If a rotation is aborted *after* the child
has stopped, the session is recovered on its own seat with auto-handoff still
armed — an elective rotation never costs you the guarantee. It is on
by default; `HEADROOM_PREEMPTIVE=0` is the one-run kill switch for all of it
and `HEADROOM_PREEMPTIVE_SESSION=0` for just the 5-hour trigger (which never
disables the 5h *target* rule), and the thresholds are config:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "preemptive_handoff": true,
    "preemptive_scoped_percent": 93,
    "preemptive_overall_percent": 95,
    "preemptive_session_handoff": true,
    "preemptive_session_percent": 97
  }
}
```

`HEADROOM_PREEMPTIVE_SESSION_MARGIN` (default 10) is how many points below the
5h threshold a target must be before a 5h crossing will move onto it.

### Context backstop: never lose a session to its own window

Usage caps are not the only wall. A long session fills its **context window**,
and at 0% remaining the conversation is over — with whatever it had not
written down. The intended answer is cooperative and lives in your own hooks:
warn the session early, let it write a handoff note, let it restart itself.
That produces a far better handoff than any mechanical one, so headroom stays
out of the way for as long as it can.

Underneath it, for a session that ignores the warning — wedged in a loop, or
spending its last context inside one long turn — the supervisor keeps its own
measurement. It reads the transcript's own usage records (the newest
main-thread assistant record's input + cache-read + cache-creation tokens;
sidechains and per-iteration copies are excluded so a subagent or a
multi-iteration turn cannot inflate the number) and infers the window the way
the transcript allows: a child launched with an explicit `--model …[1m]` is
known to be on the 1M window; otherwise usage above ~205k tokens can only have
been served by that window, and anything below assumes the standard 200k.
`HEADROOM_CTX_WINDOW` overrides both.

At **10% remaining**, and only with the child provably idle by the same
three-proof machinery preemptive rotation uses, headroom forces one **lossless**
rotation: stop, then `--resume … --fork-session` on the **same seat**, with the
resumed session re-modelled onto the 1M-window model so the conversation
actually has room. Nothing is cleared — the fork carries the whole
conversation — the pre-rotation session id stays on disk, no account moves,
nothing is cooled, and no target is reserved. If the stop cannot be proven
clean (no `SessionEnd`, a transcript ending mid-tool-call) the session is
resumed in place instead of forked, but it always comes back — including when
the replacement itself cannot be spawned, which falls back to the plain resume
on the same seat, supervised, and prints the manual resume command if even
that refuses to start. A subscription cap landing *during* a context stop is
never absorbed the way it is for a seat rotation: there is no reserved target
here and the session would come back on a seat that has just been refused, so
the fork is abandoned, the session resumes in place with auto-handoff armed,
and the cap-reactive path moves it off the seat through the pipeline that can
actually stage it.

It is bounded on purpose: a fork inherits its parent's usage records, so
rotations are capped (two per ten minutes per supervisor, separate from the
handoff ledger's own loop guard, which a genuine cap needs) and held for a
backoff afterwards. A session already on the largest window is **not**
restarted — there is no bigger window to move it to, so headroom says so once
(loudly, via notify) and leaves it running rather than spending its last
minutes on a pointless restart; `HEADROOM_CONTEXT_BACKSTOP_ALWAYS=1` forces it
anyway. On by default, `HEADROOM_CONTEXT_BACKSTOP=0` is the kill switch, and:

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "context_backstop": true,
    "context_backstop_percent": 10
  }
}
```

The same window-fit rule applies to **every** automatic resume, not just this
one: a transcript that has outgrown the standard window is resumed on
`opus[1m]` whether it is moving for a cap, moving preemptively, being
recovered on its own seat, or being forked by the backstop. Without it a large
conversation resumed under a 200k window dies on its first prompt ("Prompt is
too long") and is stranded on a seat nobody is watching.

Every path that disables automatic handoff for a running child — a malformed
hook event, an unreadable hook journal, a lost session binding, a child that
ignores `SIGTERM` — emits a `supervision_lost` event through
`HEADROOM_NOTIFY_CMD` as well as printing to stderr, so a dashboard can show
that a session is no longer protected. Preemptive activity emits
`preemptive_scheduled`, `preemptive_handoff`, and `preemptive_held`; the
context backstop emits `context_backstop_scheduled`,
`context_backstop_rotation`, and `context_backstop_held`, plus
`context_window_fit` when a handoff resume is re-modelled to fit its window.

One-run overrides are `headroom claude --headroom-auto-handoff` and
`--headroom-no-auto-handoff`. Supervision activates when auto-handoff is
enabled, no hook-incompatible Claude flag is present, and **either** stdin,
stdout and stderr are all TTYs **or** the run opted in explicitly. That opt-in
is what supervises a **piped / non-TTY launch**: pass `--headroom-auto-handoff`
(or set `HEADROOM_HEADLESS_SUPERVISION=1`) and a scheduled or scripted session
is supervised too, so it rotates on a cap instead of stalling on it — it stops
the child and resumes the same session on a fresh account, and it never
replays work that already finished. `HEADROOM_HEADLESS_SUPERVISION=0` forces
the old exec-only behaviour for non-TTY runs; a fully interactive run is
unaffected either way. Anything else — a plain piped run with no opt-in, or a
hook-incompatible flag (`-p`/`--print`, `--output-format`, `--input-format`,
`--bare`, `--safe-mode`, `--disable-all-hooks`, `--no-session-persistence`) —
takes the normal direct-exec launch path and prints why on stderr. The
incompatible flags win in every mode: a `--print` run has no resumable
session, so it stays exec-only whatever the TTYs and the opt-in say.

Your own `--settings` (a file or an inline JSON string) is **merged**, not
obeyed instead of supervision. Claude honours one `--settings` and a second
replaces the first, so the supervisor lifts the flag off the child's argv,
merges your document underneath its own, and launches the child with the one
file it owns: your keys pass through, its hook groups run first, and the
merged document rides every rotation — including the unsupervised relaunch
that recovers a session whose rotation target could not start, which carries
your settings without the hooks. A document it cannot merge — missing, empty,
unparseable, absurdly nested, setting `disableAllHooks`/
`allowManagedHooksOnly`, or setting a `CLAUDE_*`/`HEADROOM_*` variable (or
`HOME`/`USERPROFILE`) in `env` — **refuses the launch** and names the file
and the key.
Those two namespaces are refused wholesale rather than by a list of known-bad
names: they are the CLI's and headroom's own control surfaces (which shell
runs a hook, whether it runs at all, which state tree it writes into), and a
document being read by a surface may not reconfigure it. Your own variables
pass through untouched. `--managed-settings` is refused for the same reason
and cannot be merged at all: policy settings sit above the merged document.

It never degrades to an unsupervised child, because a session that looks
launched but rotates on nothing is the failure this replaced. That includes
the opt-in `--headroom-launch-fallback`: a bare CLI cannot be supervised, so
when the argv carries `--settings` the fallback refuses and prints the exact
bare command instead of running it for you.

What carries is the conversation, model-family routing, and latest session cwd.
Background tasks, live MCP connections, pending MCP/permission approvals,
permission mode, and other ephemeral launch flags do not carry. If termination
races a tool call, Claude may re-drive that interrupted call on resume; headroom
prints a notice because a side effect could therefore execute twice. See
Known limits before enabling automation on a new
platform.

## Platform support

Linux and macOS support the complete CLI, including supervised Claude
auto-handoff. The one exception is `headroom ops-status`, whose session census
reads `/proc`: on macOS it reports account batteries and `sessions: null`.
Windows v1 supports collection, `status`, `pick`/`env`, token
stats and history, and dashboard build/serve. Invoke it from PowerShell or
Command Prompt with the stdlib entrypoint:

```powershell
python -m headroom collect
python -m headroom status
python -m headroom serve --demo
```

On Windows, `headroom claude` still selects an account but launches the CLI
unsupervised. Supervised auto-handoff, transactional handoff, and the menu-bar
app are not yet supported. Git Bash/MSYS2 users may also use `bin/headroom`;
the launcher converts its checkout path for the native Python interpreter.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.9+ (stdlib only — no pip installs) on Windows, macOS,
or Linux, and the `claude` and/or `codex` CLIs you already use. (On macOS the
Claude token lives in the login Keychain; headroom reads it directly — approve
the Keychain prompt on first run. Multiple Claude accounts on one Mac need a
current Claude Code version — see
docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md.)

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/domanski-ai/headroom
cd headroom
./install.sh              # symlinks bin/headroom onto your PATH
headroom serve --demo     # OPTIONAL: preview it now with sample data, no setup
headroom setup            # the wizard: connects accounts, styles your dashboard
```

Want to see it before connecting anything? `headroom serve --demo` opens the
dashboard on bundled sample data — it's exactly what the screenshots show.

The wizard finds logins already on your machine (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`) and
adopts them in place — credentials are never moved, copied, or read beyond
what's needed to verify who's logged in. Extra accounts get their own isolated
config home and log in through the provider's own flow.

Then:

```bash
headroom serve --open      # live dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8377
headroom status sonnet     # who has capacity right now, and why not
headroom claude            # launch Claude Code on the best account
headroom rotate            # limit hit? cool this login, switch to the next
```

## Reading the numbers: what's LEFT

Providers report capacity as *used*, and a bare percentage next to a window
name is ambiguous the moment two surfaces disagree about which one it is —
`7d 99%` is either a spent week or an untouched one. So the surfaces you read
when you are deciding where to work all print what is **left**, and say so:

```
$ headroom status opus
model family: opus
  AVAIL  work               5h 66% left / 7d 88% left / opus 41% left
  skip   personal           5h 4% left / 7d 12% left / opus 0% left   (opus weekly cap 0% left)
-> chosen: work
```

The dashboard and the widgets use the same convention (`% left`, color-coded
green→red as it empties). Two surfaces still print what is *used*, so know
which one you are looking at: the per-account lines `headroom collect` prints
(`5h=34%` means 34% used) and the Claude Code status line (`5h 34%`, colored
green→red as it *fills* — see
integrations/claude-code). The `headroom
ops-status` JSON is machine-facing and names its fields `*_used` for the same
reason.

**A window nobody reported is never drawn as an empty one.** If a provider
window is missing from the reading, malformed, or an expired observation,
every surface says it does not know — `-` in `headroom status`, `?` in the
status line, `null` in `headroom ops-status` — and the router **holds** the
account rather than reading "no number" as "no usage". Same for an account
whose whole reading failed. The one deliberate exception: OpenAI lifted
Codex's 5-hour limit, so a live Codex account that reports no `5h` window at
all is read as having no such limit; a Codex `5h` window that is *present but
unusable* still holds.

## Stats & history

The dashboard's Stats tab charts saved provider-window utilization, summarizes
current/peak/average percentages and cap-hit episodes, and ranks the 7-day
workhorses. History contains window percentages only: never token counts,
emails, or provider identity fields. It is sampled at most once per minute and
retained for 30 days by default, with up to one extra grace day before the
amortized retention prune runs.

Set `HEADROOM_HISTORY=0` to disable history entirely. Retention and sampling can
be adjusted with `HEADROOM_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS` and
`HEADROOM_HISTORY_MIN_INTERVAL`. The two-file static dashboard remains
supported; on static hosting the Usage tab works normally and Stats explains
that the live `/history.json` feed requires `headroom serve`.

### Token stats (opt-in)

Token stats add local Codex-style insights to the same Stats tab: lifetime
tokens, peak day, daily activity, streaks, and a leaderboard ranked by real
token volume. This is **off by default** because enabling it reads local CLI
session transcripts. It makes no network requests.

Enable it in `~/.headroom/config.json`:

```json
{
  "dashboard": {
    "token_stats": true,
    "token_extra_roots": [
      {
        "label": "server-cli",
        "provider": "claude",
        "path": "/home/you/.claude"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`token_extra_roots` adds local CLI homes that are not registered account
slots. Each entry becomes its own labeled row in token rankings and contributes
to the fleet activity heatmap. Labels must be 1–40 characters, contain no `@`,
and be unique across extra-root labels and account-slot names. `provider` is
`claude` or `codex`; `path` must be an absolute path to an existing directory.
An unusable path is skipped and token telemetry is marked partial. Removing an
entry removes its row from the next dashboard payload immediately; private scan
state for it is pruned by the next token scan. Its virtual ID derives from the
label, provider, and canonical real path, so rebinding any field creates a new
row and retires the old state.

An extra-root row represents the configured **home**, not a provider account.
For a shared bare-CLI home, `server-cli` is a useful label. Historical activity
is split exactly by project when a record has `cwd`: headroom keeps only the
first directory name below the operator's home (`~` for the home itself), never
the full path. Account attribution is forward-only and deliberately stays on
the virtual row. When a Claude session file is first seen, headroom read-only
checks that home's current OAuth identity and, when its verified email uniquely
matches a registry `expected_email`, stamps the file with that slot name. The
stamp never changes. This is scan-time attribution, not proof of which login
created every turn; older and unverifiable sessions are shown as `earlier`, and
the attributed totals are never merged into real account rows.

Or set `HEADROOM_TOKEN_STATS=1` for the headroom process. Disable it by removing
that environment variable and removing the setting or changing it to `false`.
The off state does not scan session logs or attach token data to the dashboard
payload.

When enabled, headroom streams Claude Code's `projects/**/*.jsonl` and Codex's
`sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl` under each registered account home and valid extra
root. It stores daily numeric aggregates and private incremental byte-offset
state under `state/tokens/`; it never stores message content, emails, full cwd
paths, or raw provider identities. The headline count is input + output + cache creation.
Cache reads are kept as a separate number, so total tokens processed can still
be derived without inflating the headline. Scans run at most every 15 minutes
by default and only read new files or appended tails after the first backfill;
override the interval with `HEADROOM_TOKEN_SCAN_INTERVAL` (seconds).

Coverage is local to this machine and the configured registered/extra homes.
Sessions run on another machine do not appear until their logs exist here.
Static dashboard exports can show the embedded token aggregates without adding
an endpoint.

## Widgets

*图片：Menu bar widget and compact dashboard, rendered from live fleet data*

Widgets are display-only views of the same fail-closed public snapshot. The
mini dashboard app is the existing dashboard in a compact layout: open
`http://127.0.0.1:8377/widget`, or add `?compact=1` to the normal dashboard URL.
It keeps stale, held, limited, and offline state visible; it does not rotate or
select accounts.

### SwiftBar on macOS

Install [SwiftBar](https://swiftbar.app/), make sure the installed `headroom`
binary is on SwiftBar's `PATH`, then copy the one-minute plugin into SwiftBar's
plugin folder:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/SwiftBar/Plugins"
cp integrations/swiftbar/headroom.1m.sh \
  "$HOME/Library/Application Support/SwiftBar/Plugins/headroom.1m.sh"
chmod +x "$HOME/Library/Application Support/SwiftBar/Plugins/headroom.1m.sh"
headroom serve
```

Local mode runs `headroom widget-feed --swiftbar`, which renders the last
published snapshot and never initiates collection. The live server's
`/usage.json`, `/widget.json`, and `/widget.txt` feeds share one refresh gate.
The menu shows the fullest current 5-hour tank plus both windows and reset times
for every account. Its only actions are Refresh and Open dashboard.

For a headroom server on another machine, keep the server bound to loopback and
forward it over SSH. This is the only supported remote pattern for live widget
feeds:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8377:127.0.0.1:8377 user@headroom-host
launchctl setenv HEADROOM_WIDGET_URL http://127.0.0.1:8377
```

Restart SwiftBar after setting the environment variable. Do not expose
`headroom serve` on a LAN, public interface, or reverse proxy. It remains
loopback-only, validates the `Host` header, sends no CORS allowance, and marks
all responses `no-store` and `nosniff`. Remote plugin fetches have a three-second
timeout and 64 KB cap. The exact `headroom_widget_txt@1` sentinel is version
validation, not authentication; the plugin never evaluates, sources, or
executes fetched bytes. Server-rendered menu text is centrally sanitized and
contains no SwiftBar shell-execution parameters.

### Windows tray — EXPERIMENTAL

The Windows tray client is **EXPERIMENTAL**, not stable or supported as a
production integration. Make the server available at loopback (for example,
with the SSH tunnel above), preserve the four files under
`experimental/windows/icons/`, and launch it from the repository root with
Windows PowerShell 5.1:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File experimental/windows/headroom-tray.ps1
```

It uses bundled green, amber, red, and gray icons, caps the Windows tooltip at
63 characters, and offers Refresh and Open dashboard. Any HTTP, JSON, schema,
or clock failure becomes gray `OFFLINE`. A real Windows 10/11 PowerShell 5.1
E2E pass is still required before the experimental label can be reconsidered;
Windows requesters are invited to validate startup, all four transitions, both
menu actions, and clean exit.

## The commands

| command | what it does |
|---|---|
| `headroom setup` | first-run wizard: accounts + dashboard style quiz |
| `headroom connect` | add another account (guided login, clobber-proof) |
| `headroom collect` | refresh usage for every account (no tokens spent) |
| `headroom status [model]` | table: every account, how much of each window is **left**, and exactly why any is skipped |
| `headroom pick ` | print the best account name (exit 2 if none) — script-friendly |
| `headroom env ` | print the `export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=...` line for the best account |
| `headroom claude` / `codex [args]` | launch the CLI on the best account; a Claude launch is supervised so it hands off on a cap (on by default) |
| `headroom run  -- ` | headless run with automatic rotation on limit-hit |
| `headroom rotate [model]` | cool the current account, hand you the next |
| `headroom handoff` | transactional manual handoff (`--yes`, `--print`, `--model FAMILY`) |
| `headroom serve [--open]` | local live dashboard (auto-refreshes stale data) |
| `headroom serve --demo` | preview the dashboard with bundled sample data — no accounts needed |
| `headroom widget-feed --swiftbar` | render the last published snapshot for SwiftBar; never collects |
| `headroom statusline` | color-coded capacity for your Claude Code status line |
| `headroom accounts` | list the connected accounts |
| `headroom ops-status [--json]` | read-only JSON: every supervised session on this machine (mid-turn or not, subagents, context left, tmux container) plus per-account batteries — **Linux only** for the session half (see below) |
| `headroom doctor` | environment + config health check (handy for bug reports) |

`headroom ops-status` is for something *else* driving headroom — a scheduler,
a dashboard, a babysitter script — rather than for reading yourself. It writes
nothing, makes no network calls, spends no tokens, and degrades per session:
one unreadable transcript costs that session's fields, never the report. An
empty list and a failed read are never confused: `sessions` and `seats` are
lists when they were read (possibly empty) and `null` when they could not be,
with the reason in the top-level `errors` array; exit 0 if anything could be
read, 1 if nothing could. Session discovery walks `/proc`, so on macOS the
report is batteries with `sessions: null` and `session_discovery_failed` in
`errors`. The battery half comes from headroom's own private snapshot and
nowhere else; if you publish a usage feed of your own, point
`HEADROOM_OPS_FALLBACK_USAGE` at it and the command reads it when that
snapshot is unreadable.

It is also the right way to answer **"is this process safe to kill?"**. A
supervised child appears in `ps` as `claude --settings
/supervisors/-..settings.json`; the
slot name is in that path on purpose, because it is the only thing a live lane
says about itself in the process table. A long `etime` is what a healthy
supervised session looks like, not a leak. Check the pid against
`ops-status`'s `sessions` before reaping anything — see
docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md.

## Hand off a capped session

**EXPERIMENTAL.** With automatic handoff off, after Claude reaches its cap run `/exit`, then run
`headroom handoff`. It verifies and copies the conversation transcript to the
best other Claude account, cools the capped slot, and resumes from the same
working directory with a new session id. Use `--print` to stage the handoff and
print the exact resume command without running it; use `--yes` for a confirmed
non-interactive handoff. If the journal lacks a model, pass `--model FAMILY`.
`FAMILY` must name a scoped Claude family such as `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or
`fable`; generic `claude` is not enough to enforce model-scoped caps.
`--yes` and `--print` are mutually exclusive. The source transcript is never
changed or deleted. Every manual handoff refuses an unresolved tool call unless
`--force` is given; even a 99–100% provider snapshot is cooldown evidence, not
authenticated cap proof.

## How the reads work (and why they're safe)

- **Claude — real-time.** Your login token already has access to
  `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`, the endpoint the Claude apps themselves
  use to draw their usage UI. headroom calls it read-only and verifies the
  organization the response belongs to matches the login bound to that slot —
  a swapped or clobbered login can never report another account's headroom.
  Claude usage is always live.
- **Codex — real-time.** headroom reads Codex usage live from the Codex
  **app-server** (`codex app-server` → `account/rateLimits/read` +
  `account/read`), bound to each account's own config home. That's a live,
  identity-verified read of the same rate-limit data ChatGPT/Codex uses — not
  a scrape of stale session logs — so Codex usage is as current as Claude's,
  and Codex accounts are **routed and rotated** just like Claude ones.
  (On an older Codex CLI without the app-server, headroom falls back to a
  best-effort session-log read and the router holds those accounts until a
  fresh reading appears.)

Every account is optional — run only Claude, only Codex, or both. Both
providers are read live, identity-bound, and fully routed.
- Snapshots are written atomically. The dashboard gets a sanitized projection
  (optionally with emails redacted) — raw identity material stays in the
  private state directory with `0600` permissions.

## Fail-closed by design

headroom never guesses. An account with a stale reading, an unverifiable
identity, a missing or malformed provider window, an out-of-range percentage,
a window the provider itself flags critical while it is live, or an active
cooldown is *held* — shown on the dashboard as held, skipped by the router,
with the reason spelled out in `headroom status`. If no account has proven
capacity, `pick` says so with a non-zero exit instead of pointing you at a
login that will die mid-task.

Connecting accounts is protected the same way: a fresh login that turns out to
be an account you already connected is rolled back and refused, because two
slots silently sharing one login is how you eat a week's quota by accident.

## Claude Code integration

See integrations/claude-code — a status line
showing live capacity at the bottom of every session, and a `/rotator` skill
so Claude can rotate accounts for you when a limit hits.

## Keeping sessions fresh (reserve)

By default headroom uses each account right down to its limit. If you'd rather
not *start* a session on an account that's about to run out, set a reserve —
the setup wizard asks, or add it to `~/.headroom/config.json`:

```json
{ "routing": { "reserve_percent": 10 } }
```

Now any account with less than 10% headroom left on its 5-hour, weekly, or
model-scoped window is skipped in favour of a fuller one (and `headroom status`
shows exactly why). `0` (the default) keeps today's use-to-the-limit behaviour.

## Reserving an account (tracked, never routed)

Mark an account `"reserved": true` in `~/.headroom/config.json` to keep it on
the dashboard and in `headroom collect` while excluding it from routing
entirely: it is never returned by `pick`/`env`, never launched by
`headroom claude`/`codex`, and never chosen as a rotation or handoff target.
Use it for a login that belongs to some other workflow (a desktop app, a
teammate, a pinned service) that automatic rotation must not consume.

## Driving headroom from scripts

Six affordances make headroom composable with launch wrappers:

- **An exported config home is honoured.** If `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (or
  `CODEX_HOME`) is already set and names a registered account, that account is
  used as the *initial* slot instead of being re-routed — your wrapper's
  routing decision is consumed, not overridden. Rotation off it when it caps
  is unchanged, and if it has no proven headroom, headroom says so on stderr
  and picks another.
- **`HEADROOM_LAUNCH_MARKER=/abs/path.json`** makes `headroom claude`/`codex`
  write a small JSON file at the moment routing commits to launching the CLI
  (`{"mode": "supervised"|"exec", "account": ..., "note": ...}`; `note`
  carries the auto-handoff downgrade reason when supervision was requested
  but unavailable). The marker is written *before* the CLI starts, so a
  wrapper that wants a bare-CLI fallback can treat "headroom exited with no
  marker" as "the CLI never started" and launch directly — without ever
  racing a CLI headroom did start. If a requested marker cannot be written,
  headroom refuses to launch (exit 2) rather than leave the handshake
  dangling.
- **`--headroom-launch-fallback`** (or `HEADROOM_LAUNCH_FALLBACK=1`) makes
  `headroom claude`/`codex` exec the *bare* CLI in-process — same passthrough
  args, headroom's own flags removed — when anything fails strictly **before**
  the first CLI process was started: no routable account, a failed usage
  collect, an unwritable settings file or marker, a failed spawn. Once a CLI
  has started, a later exit — clean or capped — is a normal exit and never a
  fallback; a supervised session that eventually runs out of accounts isn't
  one either. Off by default; with it on, a wrapper can simply `exec headroom
  claude …` and never needs an external bare-CLI fallback of its own.
- **`HEADROOM_NOTIFY_CMD=`** invokes your command at launch
  transitions with one JSON argument: `{"event": "launch", "mode":
  "supervised"|"exec", "account": …, "model": …, "note": …}` when the launch
  commits, `{"event": "downgrade", …}` when supervision was requested but the
  run is exec-only, `{"event": "supervision_lost", …}` when a supervised
  child's auto-handoff disarms after launch (e.g. the SessionStart hook never
  bound, a malformed hook event, a child that ignores `SIGTERM`), and
  `{"event": "fallback", …}` when the bare-CLI fallback fires. Preemptive
  rotation adds `{"event": "preemptive_scheduled", "account", "family",
  "window", "used_percent"}` when a seat crosses its threshold and a target
  exists, `{"event": "preemptive_handoff", …, "target", "handoff_id"}` when
  the session actually moves, and `{"event": "preemptive_held", "account",
  "reason"}` when an early rotation is deferred. A cap with nowhere to go adds
  `{"event": "cap_held", "account", "reason"}` while it waits for a seat and
  `{"event": "cap_cleared", "account", "reason"}` if the capped window resets
  first — neither is a loss of supervision, and a `supervision_lost` still
  follows if the wait runs out. The context backstop adds
  `{"event": "context_backstop_scheduled", "account", "used", "window",
  "remaining_percent"}`, `{"event": "context_backstop_rotation", …, "model",
  "forked"}` when a session is forcibly continued, `{"event":
  "context_backstop_held", "account", "reason"}` when it is deferred (including
  the "already on the largest context window" case, which only an operator can
  resolve), and `{"event": "context_window_fit", "account", "model",
  "handoff_id"}` when a handoff resume is re-modelled to fit its window.
  Delivery is bounded (10s hard timeout, override with
  `HEADROOM_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT`); on timeout the command's whole process group is
  killed, and a broken or hung command is swallowed with a stderr line and
  never delays or kills the launch. Events replace external marker-polling and
  are independent of `HEADROOM_LAUNCH_MARKER`. `HEADROOM_NOTIFY_CMD` is trusted
  code — it runs as you, with your environment; the timeout bounds it, it is
  not a sandbox.
- **`HEADROOM_SLOT_LEASE=1`** takes an exclusive `flock()` on a per-account
  lock file under `~/.headroom/state/leases/` at the moment routing commits to
  an account, and treats an account another *live* launch holds as unavailable
  — so two concurrent launches deterministically pick different accounts
  instead of both grabbing the top-ranked one. The kernel drops the flock
  when the holder dies, so a crash frees the slot with no pid to reuse and no
  stale file to clean. The lock rides on the launched CLI: on the exec path it
  is inherited across `exec`, and a supervised launch hands it to the child
  (so even if the supervisor exits, the lease stays held by the live session);
  a supervised auto-handoff moves the lease to the new account before stopping
  the old one. Acquisition **fails closed**: if leasing is on but the lock (or
  its inheritability) can't be taken for an infrastructure reason, headroom
  refuses rather than launch two sessions on one account (with
  `--headroom-launch-fallback` also set, that refusal degrades to the bare CLI
  — your explicit "run something over nothing").
- **`headroom caps`** prints the scripting capabilities this binary supports
  as command-scoped JSON — `{"schema": 2, "launch_marker": {"claude": true,
  "codex": true}, "launch_fallback": {"claude": true, "codex": true, "run":
  false}, "notify_cmd": true, "slot_lease": {"claude": true, "codex": true,
  "run": false, "fail_closed": true}}` — so a launcher can see which surface
  each feature is wired into and refuse or adapt to an older binary instead of
  assuming a feature exists.

## Running across multiple machines

Usage is read **per account, from the provider's side** — so it's correct no
matter how many machines a given login is signed in on, and the reads are
token-safe: checking your headroom never disturbs or logs out your other
sessions. Run headroom on each machine against the logins it has. To view a
live server from another machine, use the Widgets section's `ssh -L` loopback
forward; for ordinary static hosting, use `headroom dashboard` as described
below. Each machine keeps its own cooldown ledger; there's no central
coordinator to stand up.

## Hosting the dashboard somewhere else

`headroom dashboard` builds two static files (`index.html` + `usage.json`)
in `~/.headroom/state/public/`. Put them behind any static host or reverse
proxy; add a cron for `headroom collect` to keep the JSON fresh. Turn on
`redact_emails` in setup if the page might be visible to others.

## Security posture

The engine was adversarially reviewed cross-model (GPT-5.6 at x-high
reasoning effort) before first release; every fixable finding is patched and
the deliberate tradeoffs are documented in
docs/KNOWN-LIMITS.md. Highlights: auth-override
environment variables are scrubbed from every provider subprocess, usage
snapshots are atomic with a sanitized public projection (emails redacted by
default), authenticated requests never follow redirects, corrupt protective
state holds routing instead of clearing it, and stale data is always shown
as held — never promoted to live.

## A note on multiple accounts

headroom manages accounts you legitimately hold — a personal plan, a work
plan, a team seat. It doesn't create accounts, share credentials, or bypass
provider controls; it just routes your own tools at your own logins and tells
you what's left. Check your providers' terms if you're unsure what applies
to your setup.

## Who builds this

headroom is built and maintained by [Paul Domanski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-domanski-ai/)
at **[Domanski.AI](https://domanski.ai)**, Cape Town.

Domanski.AI installs AI agents into existing roles inside real businesses, and
runs its own operations on the same multi-agent stack it sells. headroom came
out of that: running many agents across several provider accounts makes
capacity the thing that actually stops you, so it needed a live answer rather
than a guess.

If that is the problem you have, [domanski.ai](https://domanski.ai) is where to
find the rest of the work.
