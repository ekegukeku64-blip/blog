You know him. Long ponytail. Oval glasses. Been at the company longer than the version control. You show him fifty lines; he says nothing and replaces them with one.

Ponytail puts him inside your AI agent. Skills plus two lifecycle hooks, installed in one command.


  
    
      
      
    
  


## Before / after

You ask for a date picker.


  
    
    
  


## How it works

Before writing code, the agent stops at the first rung that holds.


  
    
    
  


Text version

```
1  does this need to exist?      →  no. skip it (yagni)
2  is it already in this repo?   →  reuse it
3  does the stdlib do it?        →  use it
4  does the platform do it?      →  use it
5  does an installed dep do it?  →  use it
6  can it be one line?           →  write the line
7  nothing above held            →  the minimum that works
```


The ladder runs *after* it understands the problem, not instead of it. Lazy about the solution, never about reading.

> **Lazy, not negligent.** Validation, error handling, security, and accessibility are never on the chopping block.

## Numbers

Real Claude Code sessions on a real repo.

| | |
|:--|:--|
| Code written | **~54% less** (up to 94% where the agent over-builds) |
| Cost | **~20% cheaper** |
| Time | **~27% faster** |
| Safety guards kept | **100%** |

Full writeup

## Install

```bash
node ponytail.js -i
```

Pick your agent, copy the commands, done.

**Works with** `Claude Code` `Codex` `Copilot CLI` `OpenCode` `Pi` `Antigravity` `Hermes` `OpenClaw` and more.

The plugins run two tiny Node.js lifecycle hooks, so `node` needs to be on your PATH. If it isn't, the skills still work and the always-on activation just stays quiet.

## Commands

Once installed, in a skill-capable host:

| Command | What it does |
|:--|:--|
| `/ponytail [lite \| full \| ultra \| off]` | Set the intensity, or turn it off. |
| `/ponytail-review` | Review the current diff for over-engineering. |
| `/ponytail-audit` | Audit the whole repo, not just the diff. |
| `/ponytail-debt` | Collect the shortcuts you deferred into a ledger. |
| `/ponytail-help` | Quick reference. |

## FAQ

**What if I really need the 120-line cache class?**
You don't. Insist anyway and he'll build it. Slowly. Correctly. While looking at you.

**Why "ponytail"?**
You know exactly why.

## License

MIT. The shortest license that works.


  He says nothing. He writes one line. It works.
