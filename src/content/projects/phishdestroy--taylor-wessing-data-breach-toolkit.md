## 🔍 Executive Summary

The **Universal PDF Redaction Auditor & Layer Decomposer** is a professional, offline-first forensic auditing and layer decomposition suite specifically engineered to identify, verify, and sanitize visual-only PDF redaction vulnerabilities. This toolkit serves as an open-source utility for security researchers, data protection officers, and compliance auditors to verify document structural integrity before public disclosure.

### ⚖️ Technical Power Asymmetry & Opponent Vulnerability
This auditing utility is built to address a critical power imbalance in corporate data processing. When massive conglomerates (such as **Valve Corporation**) are represented by elite law firms (such as **Taylor Wessing LLP**), any systematic data exposure doesn't hurt the corporation or their high-priced lawyers—it catastrophically compromises the privacy of their **opponents** (the individual data subjects, third-party users, and minors whose sensitive personal data is leaked due to legal and technical negligence). This toolkit empowers individuals and independent auditors to verify data safety and hold corporate actors accountable.

## 📊 Case Study: The Taylor Wessing / Valve GDPR Leak

During the processing of GDPR Article 15 Subject Access Requests (SARs) regarding Steam user data, a critical security vulnerability was identified in documents processed and dispatched by external counsel **Taylor Wessing LLP** on behalf of **Valve Corporation**.

### Technical Failure Analysis
Instead of permanently sanitizing the raw character arrays inside the PDF content streams, an automated, custom PDF generation pipeline (utilizing *Aspose.PDF for .NET*) was deployed. This system programmatically queried coordinates of sensitive fields and drew **solid black vector shapes** (using PDF's `re` and `f`/`F`/`b`/`B` operators) on top of the text.

Because visual drawing layers do not alter or destroy the raw text arrays underneath, thousands of unredacted private records—including account credentials, logins, emails, security logs, and de-anonymized data of minors—remained fully intact, copyable, and extractable from the dispatched files.

### 🌐 A Universal, Multi-Vendor Audit Suite
Please note: **This toolkit is NOT limited to a single-firm exploit.** It is a universal, standard-compliant PDF structural debugger and layer decomposer. If any law firm, financial institution, government body, or corporation in the world performs visual-only redaction instead of proper data scrubbing, this multi-tool will immediately expose it. 

We sincerely hope that other international law firms are more responsible with client confidentiality and aren't too cheap to pay for standard, certified redaction software instead of writing custom, broken "DIY" script pipelines. This in-house development was a catastrophic mistake—especially considering that the outdated version of the engine they chose to compile (*Aspose.PDF 20.8*) is known to suffer from severe, unpatched security vulnerabilities, including **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. But apparently, self-proclaimed "IT lawyers" don't care about basic system security or unpatched code execution flaws. :)

> [!CAUTION]
> ### 🚨 DIALOGUE WITH DR. PATRICK (THE COVER-UP)
> PhishDestroy formally notified Taylor Wessing LLP's DPO and Salary Partner, **Dr. Patrick Zurheide**, regarding this massive, systematic exposure of Steam users' PII under GDPR Article 32. 
> 
> The response received confirmed that the firm is completely inadequate, deeply incompetent, and has **absolutely no intention of notifying affected data subjects, taking accountability, or warning the public**. 
> 
> They thought they could silence the community with expensive legal threats, but they forgot one thing: **the truth is written losslessly inside the byte streams.**

### Exhibit A: The "Entertaining" Data Breach

Below is the exact, unedited response received from **Dr. Patrick Zurheide** (Salary Partner at Taylor Wessing LLP) after PhishDestroy formally notified the firm of their catastrophic PDF redaction failure and the subsequent leak of Steam users' data.

Instead of initiating a GDPR Article 33 breach notification, he chose to write this:

> **From:** p.zurheide@taylorwessing.com
> **Date:** August 19, 2026
> 
> "Guten Tag PhishDestroy-Team,
> 
> Vielen Dank für Ihre anscheinend übersetzte, aber durchaus unterhaltsame Nachricht. Auf welche Kommunikation „mit strafrechtlicher Verfolgung“ an das PhishDestroy-Team referenzieren Sie denn? Ich bin mir sicher mit PhishDestroy in keiner Form jemals zuvor kommuniziert zu haben. Bitte stellen Sie diese angebliche Kommunikation daher bereit, um zu verstehen, worum es überhaupt geht.
> 
> Ihrem Schreiben ist inhaltlich leider schwer bis gar nicht zu folgen. Als Hinweis: Ein Disclaimer, wie unten in Ihrem Schreiben, was vermeintlich nicht gemacht/beabsichtigt wird, ist bedeutungslos, wenn diesem die eigentlichen Handlungen entgegenstehen.
> 
> Patrick Zurheide"

### 🔍 PhishDestroy Translation & Analysis for the Non-German IT Community:

1. **"Vielen Dank für Ihre anscheinend übersetzte, aber durchaus unterhaltsame Nachricht."**
   * *Translation:* "Thank you for your apparently translated, but quite entertaining message."
   * *Analysis:* A highly paid "IT Law Expert" just called a forensic notification of a massive GDPR data leak—involving minors' exposed Steam accounts—"entertaining." 

2. **"Ich bin mir sicher mit PhishDestroy in keiner Form jemals zuvor kommuniziert zu haben."**
   * *Translation:* "I am sure I have never communicated with PhishDestroy in any form before."
   * *Analysis:* The classic corporate lawyer tactic of playing dumb. He ignores the fact that he sent criminal threats to the very Steam user we are assisting, choosing instead to argue semantics about the "PhishDestroy" brand name rather than fix his leaking servers.

3. **"Ihrem Schreiben ist inhaltlich leider schwer bis gar nicht zu folgen."**
   * *Translation:* "Unfortunately, the content of your letter is difficult or impossible to follow."
   * *Analysis:* We provided him with exact hex-values, the metadata of his PDF, the 36-second batch pipeline timestamps, and the specific `Aspose 20.8` version causing the leak. Apparently, IT metrics are too "difficult to follow" for a Doctor of IT Law.

**Conclusion:** 
When the people gatekeeping EU data privacy treat severe security vulnerabilities as a joke and prioritize their egos over compliance, the public must take auditing into their own hands. That is why this Toolkit exists.

## 🛠️ MULTI-TOOL CAPABILITIES

This suite offers three complementary, fully client-side modes to analyze and dismantle fake visual redactions from Taylor Wessing or any other incompetent organization:

| Mode / Feature | Technology | Target Elements | Output Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **📡 Mode 1: X-Ray Scanner** | PDF.js (Mozilla) | Searchable Text Layers | Live Terminal Stream |
| **✂️ Mode 2: Layer Stripper** | PDF-Lib (Indirect Objects) | Vector Paths (`re`, `f`, `b`) | Lossless Clean PDF |
| **🔎 Mode 3: Collision Audit** | PyMuPDF (Fitz Layout) | Overlapping Text & Graphics | `.txt` Leaks Report |


🛰️ Expand Mode 1 Details (X-Ray Live Terminal)


Splits your workspace into a responsive dual-pane view:
* **Left Pane:** Renders the visual PDF, displaying the black masking blocks.
* **Right Pane:** A synchronized green-on-black terminal that losslessly pulls the underlying unredacted text characters in real-time as you flip pages. You see the black box, but you read the secret instantly.


✂️ Expand Mode 2 Details (Surgical Layer Stripper)


A surgical, global stream-level sanitization engine:
* **Deep Stream Swapping:** Scans every single xref indirect object in the PDF—including Page Contents and nested **Form XObjects** (where template drawings are hidden).
* **Operator Purge:** Replaces rectangular visual paint commands (`re f`, `re F`, `re b`, `re B`, etc.) with the `n` (no-paint) operator. It physically deletes the black bars, dropping Page 1 black drawings to **exactly 0**, leaving a clean, naked document for download.

## 🔍 CODE WALKTHROUGH


🐍 View Python Global Stream Sanitizer


The core script uses PyMuPDF's low-level stream reading interfaces. It parses the decompressed cross-reference (`xref`) stream of each page and resource, applies a whitespace-preserving regular expression to swap visual fill operators with a non-painting operator, and reconstructs the PDF stream with full garbage collection and stream deflation.

```python
import re, fitz

def strip_black_bars_global(input_path, output_path):
    doc = fitz.open(input_path)
    for xref in range(1, doc.xref_length()):
        if not doc.is_stream(xref):
            continue
        try:
            # Skip binary streams (Fonts, Images, Halftones)
            obj_dict = doc.xref_object(xref)
            if any(m in obj_dict for m in ["/Type /Font", "/Subtype /Image", "/Type /Halftone"]):
                continue
                
            stream_bytes = doc.xref_stream(xref)
            text = stream_bytes.decode('latin-1')
            
            # Swap rectangular painting operators with no-fill 're n', preserving newlines
            modified_text, count = re.subn(
                r'\bre\s+([fFbB]\*?)(?=\s|$)',
                lambda m: f"re{m.group(0)[2:-len(m.group(1))]}n",
                text
            )
            if count > 0:
                doc.update_stream(xref, modified_text.encode('latin-1'))
        except Exception:
            continue
    doc.save(output_path, garbage=4, deflate=True, clean=True)
    doc.close()
```


☕ View Javascript Browser-Side Sanitizer


The Web GUI performs the identical structural modifications in-memory using `pdf-lib` via low-level object context mapping.

```javascript
async function sanitizePdfClientSide(rawPdfBytes) {
    const { PDFDocument, PDFName, decodePDFRawStream } = PDFLib;
    const pdfDocInstance = await PDFDocument.load(rawPdfBytes);
    const context = pdfDocInstance.context;
    const indirectObjects = context.enumerateIndirectObjects();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < indirectObjects.length; i++) {
        const [ref, pdfObject] = indirectObjects[i];
        
        if (pdfObject && typeof pdfObject.getContents === 'function' && pdfObject.dict) {
            const dict = pdfObject.dict;
            const type = dict.get(PDFName.of('Type'));
            const subtype = dict.get(PDFName.of('Subtype'));
            
            if (type === PDFName.of('Font') || subtype === PDFName.of('Image') || type === PDFName.of('Halftone')) {
                continue;
            }
            
            try {
                const rawData = decodePDFRawStream(pdfObject).decode();
                const text = Array.from(rawData, byte => String.fromCharCode(byte)).join('');
                const modifiedText = text.replace(/re(\s+)([fFbB]\*?)(?=\s|$)/g, 're$1n');
                
                if (text !== modifiedText) {
                    const modifiedData = new Uint8Array(modifiedText.length);
                    for (let k = 0; k < modifiedText.length; k++) {
                        modifiedData[k] = modifiedText.charCodeAt(k) & 0xff;
                    }
                    
                    const newStreamObj = context.flateStream(modifiedData);
                    const keys = dict.keys();
                    for (let k = 0; k < keys.length; k++) {
                        const key = keys[k];
                        if (key !== PDFName.of('Filter') && key !== PDFName.of('Length')) {
                            newStreamObj.dict.set(key, dict.get(key));
                        }
                    }
                    context.assign(ref, newStreamObj);
                }
            } catch (err) {
                continue;
            }
        }
    }
    return await pdfDocInstance.save();
