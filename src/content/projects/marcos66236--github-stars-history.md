## Why star history matters

GitHub uses star velocity as a core signal for its **Trending** page, **Explore** feed, and **search ranking**. A repository gaining 200 stars in 24 hours is more likely to surface than one with 10,000 total stars and flat recent growth.

This tool gives you that data: how many stars a repository gained each day, across its entire life. Compare your project against competitors, measure a launch, verify whether a star spike was earned or delivered, or track your own growth week by week.

## What changed in 2026

Until June 2026, tools like this one read the stargazers listing endpoint to reconstruct per-star timestamps. GitHub then [restricted stargazer and watcher lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-06-30-upcoming-access-restrictions-to-public-api-endpoints-and-ui-views) to repository admins and collaborators to protect user privacy — breaking most star-history tools in the ecosystem.

In September 2026, GitHub shipped the fix: a [privacy-safe star history endpoint](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-09-04-new-api-endpoint-provides-privacy-safe-star-history-data) that returns weekly and daily aggregate counts with no stargazer identities. **Version 1.1.0 of this tool migrated to that endpoint.** It works for any public repository again, with no ownership or special access required.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Complete daily history** | Daily star counts from the repository's first star to today |
| **Growth windows** | 7-day, 30-day, 365-day and all-time rates |
| **Peak detection** | The single best day and its exact count |
| **Multi-repo comparison** | Pass any number of repositories and compare their curves |
| **Velocity report** | 30-day view with terminal bar chart (`examples/velocity_report.py`) |
| **CSV + JSON export** | Machine-readable daily series for charting or analysis |
| **Rate-limit aware** | Header-based backoff — no wasted probe requests |
| **No API key needed** | Public data for public repositories; a token only raises rate limits |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcos66236/github-stars-history.git
cd github-stars-history
pip install -r requirements.txt
python star_history.py sindresorhus/np
```

Or install it as a command-line tool:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Marcos66236/github-stars-history.git
star-history owner/repo
```

No token, no signup, no configuration. Works with Python 3.8+.

## Usage

### Single repository

```bash
python star_history.py sindresorhus/np
```

```
Fetching star history for sindresorhus/np...
  Fetched 2,227 stars so far (page 10)...
  Total: 7,712 stars (20 week pages)

Repository: sindresorhus/np
Total stars: 7,712
Created: 2015-08-16
Age: 11 years, 1 month

Growth summary:
  Last 30 days:   +5 stars (0.2/day)
  Last 365 days:  +117 stars (0.3/day)
  All time:       +7,712 stars (1.9/day)

Peak day: 2016-07-07 (+373 stars)
```

### Compare multiple repositories

```bash
python star_history.py facebook/react vuejs/vue sveltejs/svelte
```

### Velocity report

```bash
python examples/velocity_report.py sindresorhus/np
```

Shows the last 30 days of star gains as a terminal bar chart.

### Export formats

```bash
python star_history.py owner/repo --format csv    # daily series (default)
python star_history.py owner/repo --format json   # history + full analysis
python star_history.py owner/repo --summary       # print only, no files
```

CSV output is one row per day: `date,stars`. JSON output adds the full analysis block and metadata.

### GitHub token (optional)

Without a token you get 60 requests/hour; with a token, 5,000. Large repositories need a handful of requests per decade of history, so most users never hit the limit.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
python star_history.py torvalds/linux
```

Generate one at github.com/settings/tokens — no special scopes are required for public repositories.

## How it works

```
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stargazers/history
```

The endpoint returns weeks of aggregate daily counts, newest first, paginated backwards to the repository's creation week. The tool reconstructs a single daily series, computes growth windows, and stores nothing.

```
[
  { "week": 1789257600, "total": 126, "days": [0, 0, 0, 0, 104, 22, 0] },
  ...
]
```

Two deliberate design decisions:

- **Daily aggregates, not identities.** GitHub no longer exposes who starred a repository to third parties — and this tool never needed that to measure growth. Counts are enough for velocity, peaks and comparisons.
- **Header-based rate limiting.** Remaining quota is read from every API response instead of probed with extra requests, so a long history costs exactly as many requests as it has pages.

## FAQ

**Does this work for any repository?**
Yes — any public repository, whether you own it or not. Private repositories require a token with access.

**Why does the output show daily counts instead of usernames?**
GitHub restricted stargazer identities to repository admins in June 2026. The public star history endpoint returns aggregate counts only, which is what growth analysis actually uses.

**How far back does the history go?**
To the repository's creation week. The tool paginates through every week automatically.

**Can I see who starred a repository?**
Not through this tool. If it is your repository, GitHub's UI and API still give you full stargazer access. For anyone else's, that data is no longer public.

**How do I detect a suspicious star spike?**
Plot the daily series and look for vertical jumps with no external explanation — a launch, a release, a viral post. Our companion guide covers the checks: [How to tell if GitHub stars are real](https://buygithub.com/how-to-tell-if-github-stars-are-real/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github-stars-history).

**Do I need Python?**
For this CLI, yes. The raw endpoint is plain HTTP and works from any language — see *How it works* above.
