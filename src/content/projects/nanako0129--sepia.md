# sepia

**English** | 繁體中文

> De-AI writing at the layer that actually gives AI away. Fiction gets its narrative architecture repaired before anyone touches word choice; professional documents (release notes, PR replies, postmortems, tickets, technical articles) each get rules matched to their venue.

A portable [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/specification) for Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, and Antigravity. One canonical `SKILL.md`, no per-platform forks. Four operations: **write**, **review** (diagnose only), **refactor** (minimal edits), **recreate** (full rewrite).

## Why another humanizer

Every popular humanizer edits word choice and syntax. [StoryScope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.03136) (Russell et al., 2026: 61,608 stories, human + 5 frontier LLMs) showed that a classifier using **narrative-structure features alone** detects AI fiction at 93.2% macro-F1, and that editing the surface style away barely moves it (95.5% → 93.9%). The tells that survive are architectural: themes explained by the narrator, single-track causally-tidy plots, emotions rendered only as bodily sensation, no real-world references, no reader, linear time, endings resolved by protagonist growth and acceptance.

sepia turns those measured gaps, together with the eleven related studies digested in `research/`, into a three-pass writing and revision protocol for fiction:

| Pass | Layer | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Narrative architecture (fiction) | stop explaining the theme, loosen the causal chain, back-load revelations, mix emotion modes, sparse character networks, name real things |
| 2 | Discourse flow | de-template the paragraph-question sequence, fix the mid-story sag, vary rhythm and positions |
| 3 | Surface style | the classic layer: clichés, syntax templates, vocabulary, register |

Plus a 30-feature diagnosis rubric and per-model fingerprint corrections (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi).

Professional prose fails differently. The studies point at filler that carries no information, hedging where a judgment was needed, chatbot leftovers, register that ignores the venue, and formatting that looks stamped out. Each document type gets a thin rule file on top of one shared checklist:

| Domain | The gist |
|---|---|
| Release notes / announcements | user impact first, artifacts per claim, no marketing inflation |
| PR / issue replies | answer first, cite `file:line`, no reflex praise, length ∝ stakes |
| Postmortems | blameless toward people, merciless toward mechanisms; timestamps, dead ends, owned action items |
| Tickets / work orders | title = outcome, testable acceptance criteria, link don't repeat |
| Technical articles | open at the problem, one real dead end, one committed opinion, numbers with conditions |

The governing principle throughout: **calibrate to the human distribution, don't invert the AI one.** Humans sit at moderate values; a story with every rule applied is a new fingerprint. The skill selects 3–5 moves per story and leaves slack.

## Install

Every platform has its own native install, each paired with its update commands. Default everywhere is **user scope** — install once, use it in every project.

### Claude Code

```bash
# install
claude plugin marketplace add Nanako0129/sepia
claude plugin install sepia@sepia --scope user

# update
claude plugin marketplace update sepia
claude plugin update sepia
```

The in-session `/plugin install` dialog asks you to pick a scope — choose **User** there.

### Codex

```bash
# install
codex plugin marketplace add Nanako0129/sepia
codex plugin add sepia@sepia

# update — refresh the marketplace snapshot, then re-add to pick up the new version
codex plugin marketplace upgrade sepia
codex plugin add sepia@sepia
```

### Grok Build

```bash
# install
grok plugin install Nanako0129/sepia --trust

# update
grok plugin update
```

Grok also auto-discovers a Claude Code install of sepia if you have one; either route works.

### Antigravity

No marketplace here — the native install is placing the skill folder, plus the `/sepia` slash workflow:

```bash
# install
git clone https://github.com/Nanako0129/sepia.git ~/.sepia
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/skills ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows
cp -R ~/.sepia/skills/sepia ~/.gemini/config/skills/sepia
cp ~/.sepia/.agents/workflows/sepia.md ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/sepia.md

# update
git -C ~/.sepia pull
rm -rf ~/.gemini/config/skills/sepia && cp -R ~/.sepia/skills/sepia ~/.gemini/config/skills/sepia
cp ~/.sepia/.agents/workflows/sepia.md ~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/sepia.md
```

### All four at once (alternative)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nanako0129/sepia/main/install.sh | bash
```

Clones the repo to `~/.sepia` (override with `SEPIA_HOME`) and installs at user scope for all four platforms; re-running the same line is also the update. Prefer to inspect first? Clone it yourself and run `./install.sh` from the checkout. Either way it installs:

| Platform | Where | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/sepia` | symlink |
| Codex | `~/.agents/skills/sepia` | symlink |
| Grok Build | `~/.grok/skills/sepia` | symlink |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/config/skills/sepia` + `/sepia` global workflow | copy |

### Skills CLI (alternative, 77+ agents)

```bash
npx skills add Nanako0129/sepia -g     # -g = user scope; the default is project
npx skills update -g                   # update
```

### Project scope (alternative)

When one repo should pin its own copy, commit `skills/sepia/` into that repo as `.agents/skills/sepia` (Codex + Antigravity) or `.claude/skills/sepia` (Claude Code).
