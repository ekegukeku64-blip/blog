# opentax-engine

**A US tax calculator that shows its work — and can prove it.**

Three ideas, that's the whole project:

1. **Ask** it a tax question with plain facts (`--wages 50000`).
2. It answers with a **proof**: every rule it applied, with the law it came from (`26 U.S.C. § 63(c)` …), every assumption it made.
3. Anyone can **verify** that proof offline. If it can't derive an answer from its encoded rules, it refuses — it never guesses.

Open source (AGPL-3.0, with commercial licenses available), exact to the cent (no floating point), built to be extended.

## Try it

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm opentax eval --status mfj --wages 120000 --kids 2
```

```
us.federal.income_tax_after_credits  $5,640.00
├─ us.federal.income_tax_before_credits  $10,040.00   [26 U.S.C. § 1(j); Rev. Proc. 2025-32]
│  └─ us.federal.taxable_income  $87,800.00           [26 U.S.C. § 63(b)]
│     ├─ us.federal.agi  $120,000.00
│     │     ├─ fact wages = $120,000.00
│     │     └─ assumed taxableInterest = $0.00 (default)
│     └─ us.federal.standard_deduction  $32,200.00    [Rev. Proc. 2025-32 § 4.14]
└─ us.federal.ctc  $4,400.00                          [§ 24, as amended by OBBBA § 70104]

Assumptions (6): taxableInterest = $0.00, isAge65OrOlder = false, …
corpus sha256:6ff44719…
```

It answers under **the law in force on the date you ask about** — `--as-of` defaults to today; pass `--as-of 2025-12-31` and the same facts derive under TY2025 rules instead (different standard deduction, different brackets, cited to the other Rev. Proc.).

Money is written in **dollars** (`50000`, `"$50,000"`, `"1234.56"`). Not sure what inputs exist? `pnpm opentax facts` lists them all. More facts than fit in flags? Use a JSON file: `--facts examples/mfj_120k_2kids.json`.

**Or skip the terminal entirely** — the engine is pure TypeScript with zero platform
dependencies, so the whole thing runs in a browser:

```bash
pnpm -F @invaro/opentax-playground build && open packages/playground/dist/index.html
```

One 130 KiB self-contained HTML file: engine + full rule corpus + verifier, no server,
no network, works from `file://`. Compute, read the proof tree, download the proof —
then paste it into the **Verify** tab and watch your own browser re-derive every step
(alter one byte and it says exactly what broke). Same corpus Merkle root the CLI prints.

Save a proof, verify a proof:

```bash
pnpm opentax eval --status single --wages 50000 --proof proof.json
pnpm opentax verify proof.json     # ✓ VERIFIED — re-derived independently, every step matches
```

Change one byte of the proof — or one rule — and `verify` fails and says exactly what broke: the file was altered, the corpus is a different version, or a step doesn't re-derive.

Don't want to trust our verifier? The format is fully specified — canonical JSON, hashing, Merkle construction, node semantics, test vectors — in **docs/PROOF-FORMAT.md**, so you can write an independent checker in whatever language you trust.

## When it can't answer

It tells you, in one consistent shape, and never makes something up:

| exit code | error code | meaning | what to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | `NEEDS_FACTS` | you didn't give it enough | it lists every missing fact and the exact flag to add |
| 3 | `UNHANDLED_ENUM_CASE`, `NO_APPLICABLE_RULE` | the rules for this case/date aren't encoded yet | see coverage below; add them (it's just data) |
| 1 | anything else | bad input, failed verification | read the message |

Every error is `{ code, message, data, hint }` — same shape for humans, scripts, and AI agents.

## The AI-agent use case: never let a model invent a tax number again

LLMs *will* confidently produce wrong tax figures — most training data predates the OBBBA entirely. Two integration patterns fix that:

**1. Oracle pattern (MCP)** — the model never computes; it calls the engine:

```bash
claude mcp add opentax -- node packages/mcp/dist/index.js
```

Nine tools: `calculate_tax`, `verify_tax_claim`, `verify_fact` (fact-check any claimed dollar amount — "CTC is $2,000/child" → *refuted, it's $2,200, § 24(h)(2) as amended by OBBBA*), `lookup_tax_parameter`, `is_tipped_occupation` (the full Treasury occupation list as data), `list_input_facts`, `explain_rule`, `find_tax_cliffs`, `compare_filing_statuses`. Every response carries its assumptions and the corpus hash, so the agent can quote the law and the user can re-verify.

**2. Guardrail pattern (`opentax check`)** — the model answers, your harness gates it:

```bash
$ opentax check --status mfj --wages 120000 --kids 2 --expect 6600
✗ REFUTED   claimed $6,600.00, but the law derives $5,640.00 (off by $960.00)
$ echo $?
1        # wire this into your eval suite / response pipeline
```

Exit 0 = verified, 1 = refuted (with the correct value), 2 = the claim can't be checked without more facts. A one-line post-processing step turns any tax-adjacent agent from "plausible" to "provable."

Plus the general contract: add `--json` to **any** command — single JSON object, `ok: true|false`, stable error codes and exit codes, no ANSI. Full agent docs in **AGENTS.md**.

## What's covered today (tax years 2025 & 2026, current law)

**Every W-2 household, all five filing statuses, refunds included.** The default answer is **net tax** — negative means the government owes you.

- **Individual (Form 1040)** — brackets, standard & itemized deductions (Schedule A with the OBBBA SALT cap), capital gains & qualified dividends with full § 1222 Schedule D netting, AMT, Social Security taxation, retirement income incl. the § 72(d) pension Simplified Method, residential rental income with § 168 depreciation, SE tax, NIIT & Additional Medicare, kiddie tax, capital losses, HSA, student-loan interest, IRA deduction, foreign earned income exclusion.
- **Credits** — CTC/ACTC + ODC, EITC (all child counts), education (AOTC/LLC), child & dependent care, saver's, adoption, premium tax credit (2025 no-cliff / 2026 cliff) — plus proof-backed dependent determination.
- **OBBBA, both years** — tips & overtime deductions (with the 71-occupation eligibility list), senior deduction, car-loan interest, non-itemizer charitable, § 68 haircut, and the 2026 parameter shifts throughout.
- **Business & corporate (Form 1120)** — QBI § 199A full mechanics, SEP/solo-401(k), § 179 + bonus + R&D expensing + § 163(j), K-1 pass-through, entity classification, flat 21% with charitable/DRD/NOL mechanics, BEAT, corporate FTC, § 250, penalty taxes, QSBS, buyback excise, corporate estimates.
- **Estates & trusts (Form 1041)**, household employment (Schedule H), farmers & fishermen, estimated-tax safe harbors + annualized installments, withholding checkup.
- **Out of scope refuses loudly** — consolidated returns, REIT/RIC, fiscal-year returns, CAMT: a named refusal, never a silent wrong answer. (State returns for IL/VA/CA/NY/PA live in the composer, via the MCP server and `opentax state` — PA includes the eight-class netting rules, Schedule SP Tax Forgiveness, and the new Working Pennsylvanians Tax Credit.)

| **Foreign earned income exclusion (§ 911)** — $130,000 → $132,900, with the real **§ 911(f) stacking rule** (remaining income taxed at the rates it would face WITH the excluded amount — a fixture pins $1,000 of TI taxed at 24%, not 10%); § 32(c)(1)(C) EITC denial; housing exclusion, gains, and AMT-preference combos refuse | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Estates & trusts (Form 1041, § 1(e))** — the compressed 10/24/35/37 brackets (both Rev. Proc. tables), § 642(b) exemptions ($600/$300/$100); retained capital gains refuse | ✅ | ✅ |

| **Corporate estimated tax fixed to § 6655(g)(1)** — the required annual payment now includes BEAT and subtracts FTC/GBC (v1 understated a BEAT payer's installments) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Fiscal-year / short-period returns (§§ 15/443) refuse explicitly** — OBBBA parameters key to the taxable year's *beginning*; a straddling filer would silently get the wrong year's rates | ❌ refuses | ❌ refuses |

**Independently validated** (full methodology in docs/METHODOLOGY.md): a differential harness runs **572 TY2025 scenarios** through both opentax and **PolicyEngine US**, a separately-built open-source model. Result: **533 agree to the exact cent, zero unexplained disagreements**, and every explained difference is triaged with a primary-source citation in known-differences.json. The harness once caught a real bug in **us** — fixed, fixture-pinned, both engines now agree to the cent.

**Is it correct?** Exact bigint-cents math — floats never enter · golden fixtures asserting every intermediate to the cent · below $100,000 the engine reproduces the printed IRS Tax Table method exactly (verified against 41 sampled rows of the 2025 Publication 1040 table, all four statuses) · every rule and the fact catalog Merkle-pinned in `corpus.lock.json` · every fixture round-trips through `verify` · every dollar read from the primary source text.

**Honest caveats.** Where the engine approximates, the rule's own citation says so; where a condition can't be verified, the default is conservative — $0 or a refusal, never a guess. The big ones: earned income ≈ wages and MAGI ≈ AGI in several phase-outs; EITC qualifying children approximated by the CTC child count; a handful of niche interactions refuse outright.


Complete list of approximations and limits

Earned income ≈ wages (EITC, ACTC, dependent limit); MAGI ≈ AGI (senior/tips/overtime/car-loan phase-outs); EITC qualifying children approximated by the CTC child count (§ 32(c)(3) age limits differ); § 32(d) separated-spouse exception not modeled (MFS gets $0 — conservative); 3+-child ACTC social-security-tax alternative not modeled; tips occupation-list, car-loan vehicle conditions (new, US-assembled, personal use), charity DAF exclusion, and SSN conditions assumed satisfied; car-loan MFS treatment encoded conservatively as $0; capital-loss carryover tracks the amount but not the ST/LT character split; rental depreciation is GDS residential building basis only (ADS elections, separately-dated improvements, final-year stub, and mid-year dispositions refuse or are out of scope) and rental-loss years route to the § 469 facts; the pension Simplified Method covers post-Nov-1996 qualified-plan starting dates (the General Rule for nonqualified annuities is not modeled); QBI ≈ SE profit − ½ SE tax − SEP − SE health insurance (+ K-1); the § 199A W-2 wages and UBIA default to $0 (conservative) and aggregation/REIT/PTP components are not modeled; investment income for NIIT/EITC is the netted Schedule D result plus interest and dividends; Schedule SE line-rounding may differ by cents from the exact formula. Credit block: § 36B household income counts the taxpayer/spouse only (dependents' MAGI not modeled), 48-contiguous-states poverty guidelines (AK/HI's higher lines not modeled — conservative), annualized (not monthly) computation, and Form 8962's whole-percent/4-decimal-table rounding may differ sub-dollar from the encoded statutory linear interpolation; § 21 deemed student-spouse income ($250/$500-month) and the § 21(e)(4) living-apart exception are not modeled (MFS and no-spouse-income joint returns get $0 — conservative); § 25B assumes age 18 attained; § 23/§ 25B/§ 21 MAGI ≈ AGI. § 911: housing exclusion, preferential-gains coordination (§ 911(f)(2)), and AMT stacking (§ 911(f)(1)(B)) refuse; Form 1041 models the rate schedule + exemption only (retained gains refuse; trust AMT and qualified disability trusts not modeled); Schedule H models one household employee. Schedule A: MAGI ≈ AGI for the SALT phase-down (§ 911/931/933 add-backs); charitable is CASH to 60%-limit charities only, and § 170(d) carryovers are not tracked (conservative for the current year); mortgage assumes post-Dec-15-2017 acquisition debt (the grandfathered $1M limit is not modeled — conservative) and mortgage-insurance-premiums-as-interest (2026+) is not modeled; casualty/gambling/misc itemized deductions absent; the § 68 × § 199A interaction REFUSES rather than guess; AMT is modeled (SALT/standard/senior addbacks + entered ISO/preference items); the § 55(d)(3) MFS add-back, § 53 minimum tax credit carryforward, and depreciation-schedule AMT adjustments are not — enter the latter via --amt-preferences.


## The solver layer — ask questions a calculator can't answer

Because the rules are pure functions, `opentax` can *reason* about the tax code, not just evaluate it — and every data point is a real, proof-backed evaluation:

```
$ opentax cliffs --status hoh --wages 30000 --kids 2 --vary taxableInterest --from 10000 --to 14000

1 cliff(s) found:
  ▮ at $11,950.00: one more cent of taxableInterest costs $3,234.84
```

That's the § 32(i) EITC kill switch, located **to the exact cent** by bisection over real evaluations — one cent of interest income destroys the family's entire earned income credit.

```
opentax compare --wages 50000            # net tax under every filing status
opentax marginal --status single --at 50000    # your true marginal rate
opentax sweep --vary wages --from 0 --to 200000 --step 5000 --csv   # the whole curve
```

`cliffs` also finds every $50 CTC phase-out step (§ 24(b)'s "or fraction thereof" makes one cent past $412,000 cost $50); `invert` answers "what income first reaches tax X" by bisection — and *refuses* with `not-monotone` when the EITC region makes the answer ambiguous, rather than returning a plausible root. This is "policy simulation" as an open-source CLI command.

**This is a computation-and-citation tool, not tax advice.**

## Extending it

All tax knowledge is **data** — you add coverage by writing a rule object with a citation and a hand-computed test, never by touching engine code:

1. Write the rule (id, citation with statute + excerpt, validity dates, formula).
2. Statutory exceptions are their own rules that `override` the base with a guard — the proof shows why they did or didn't fire.
3. Add a golden fixture with expected cents you computed from the statute by hand.
4. `pnpm test && pnpm -F @invaro/opentax-corpus-us-federal gen:lock`

## Repo layout

`packages/core` — the engine (domain-general, zero deps, browser-safe) · `packages/corpus-us-federal` — the tax rules as cited data + golden tests · `packages/solve` — the reasoning layer (also domain-general) · `packages/compose` — printed-form state-return composers · `packages/cli` — the `opentax` command · `packages/playground` — the browser playground (one self-contained HTML file).

## Roadmap

Natural-language fact extraction (LLM in front, never inside the math) → statute→rules autoformalization pipeline → education credits → proof-format spec → state corpora. (Done: OBBBA amendments · TY2026 · all five filing statuses · EITC/ACTC/refunds · tips & overtime · the solver layer · differential testing vs. PolicyEngine · itemized deductions & the OBBBA SALT cap · the browser playground.)

**Currency policy:** the corpus tracks current law — when the IRS or Congress changes the numbers, the change lands as a new rule *version* with its own validity window and citation, never an in-place edit. Old proofs stay verifiable against the corpus root they were computed under.

OpenTax is **free software under the GNU AGPL-3.0**: use it, study
it, fork it, run it as a service. The one condition is the AGPL's share-alike
rule: a product or service built on this engine must publish its own complete

**Building something closed-source or proprietary?** You need a
commercial license from Invaro. That is the deal:
open products use it free, closed products pay for it. It keeps the engine
funded and the corpus current.
