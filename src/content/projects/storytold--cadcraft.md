CADCraft


  Computer-aided design and drafting; an open-source, clean-room reimplementation of Autodesk AutoCAD, rebuilt in pure Rust.


  A fast, open-source take on the AutoCAD workflow: the command line, object snaps, layers,
  dimensions, hatches, blocks and DXF drawings you already know. It runs natively on macOS,
  Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, and in the browser via WebAssembly.
  By the ArtCraft team.

  Apartment plan (examples/apartment.dxf): walls with pick-point hatching, TrueType MTEXT room labels, a TABLE, a multileader and architectural dimensions — built entirely from CADCraft commands.

    Layouts: paper space with viewports, page setups and PLOT to PDF. Double-click a viewport to work in model space through it.
    Mounting bracket: a two-view part drawing with centre lines, hidden lines, an ANSI31 section hatch and a title block.
  


## Why CADCraft

- **The workflow you know.** Type `L`, click two points, type `@5<45`, press Enter. The command
  line, prompts with clickable `[Keywords]`, AutoComplete, object snaps, polar tracking, ortho,
  direct distance entry, window and crossing selection, grips, and right-click-to-repeat behave
  the way decades of drafting habit expect.
- **Open files.** DXF is read and written natively (ASCII and binary, R12 through 2018), and DWG
  files (R13 through 2018) open and save through the open-source acadrust library. Export to SVG
  and PNG today.
- **Fast and native.** Pure Rust and egui, no Electron, no web view. One binary on macOS
  (universal), Windows, Linux and FreeBSD, plus a WebAssembly build for the browser.
- **Built for agents.** Every menu item, tool and prompt is a command. Agents can type at the
  command line exactly like a person, call any command with JSON, inspect the drawing to verify
  their work, and render it — over MCP, a JSON control channel, or the CLI.
- **Free.** MIT OR Apache-2.0, with no account and no subscription.

## What works today

CADCraft is in early, fast development. Honest status (see ROADMAP.md for parity
numbers):

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Drawing area | Model space with adaptive grid, axes, pan/zoom (wheel, middle-drag, pinch), crosshair cursor with pickbox, UCS icon, ViewCube, viewport label |
| Command line | Prompts with keywords, history, AutoComplete, aliases, `@dx,dy`, `@d | **PhotoCraft** | Image editing: layers, masks, type and real PSD files | GitHub | [Website](https://getartcraft.com/apps/photocraft) |
